<content>Introduction
On the north-east corner of the Republic of India lies the present State of Assam, situated between the twenty-fourth and twenty-eighth degrees of north latitude and eighty-ninth and ninety-seventh degrees of east longitude. The long alluvial valley of the Brahmaputra or Assam Proper, with which we are concerned in this volume, extended at the beginning of our period from the river Manah on the north bank of the Brahmaputra to the foot of the Himalayas close upon the frontier of China. On the north it is bounded by the hills inhabited by the Bhutias, the Akas, the Duflas and the Abors. The hills occupied by the Mishmis, the Khamtis and the Singphos separate Assam from China and Burma. On the south-east lies the States of Cachar and Manipur. From the Patkai hills, which form the natural boundary with Burma, runs the irregular chains of mountains commonly known as the Assam Range occupied by the Nagas, the Jayantias, the Khasis and the Garos westward in succession. Girted thus almost on all sides by mountain barrier Assam remained practically isolated. Although the river Brahmaputra formed the highway of communication, navigation along the river before the age of steam was always uncertain and at times extremely hazardous. Geography had imposed a formidable barrier on her contact with the rest of the world; although through numerous passes and river routes she was accessible to the dwellers of the neighbouring hills and, in fact, for ages past the fortunes of the two, viz., hills and plains, were closely related and inextricably interwoven.

INTRODUCTION
Prior to the advent of the East-India Company the valley of the Brahmaputra was ruled by the Ahoms, an off shoot of the Tai or the great shan stock of South-East Asia. In the early decades of the thirteenth century, Sukapha, the founder of the Ahom kingdom, crossed the Patkais and carved out a principality of his own in the south-east corner of the present district of Sibsagar. In the next three centuries the conquerors reduced to submission the Morans, the Borahis and the Nagas and the original inhabitants of the region and brought under effective control the greater part of the valley of the Brahmaputra. The emergence of the Koches in early sixteenth century called to a halt the forward policy of the Ahoms; but the most formidable enemy which challenged their authority in the west was the Mughals. To control the affairs in Western or Lower Assam, the office of the Barphukan or Viceroy was created with headquarters at Gauhati. The Ahom-Mughal conflict continued with occasional breaks for the greater part of the seventeenth century. The Mughals under Nawab Mirjumla advanced in 1662 as far as Gargaon, the capital of the kingdom, and compelled its ruler Jayadhwaj Singha (1648-63) to cede Western Assam to the Mughals. King Gadadhar Singha (1681-96) finally expelled the Mughals in 1682, reoccupied Gauhati and extended the boundary of the kingdom as far as the river Manah.
From the middle of the eighteenth century the Ahom monarchy was on the decline. The throne was occupied by a number of weak but unscrupulous rulers whose only ambition was the preservation of their own lives and power regardless of the interests of the State. The Court became the hot-bed of intrigues and conspiracies and this was followed by political assassinations and insurrections. The Moamaria rebellion which broke out in 1769 as a protest against religious intolerance of the royal family soon developed into a scramble for power. In 1778 the rebels overwhelmed the royalists, occupied the capital and the reigning king Gaurinath Singha (1780-95) had to flee for his life to Gauhati. To aggravate the situation marauders from Bengal known as the Burkandazes ravaged

the villages in the north of Kamrup. In response to Gaurinath's frantic appeals for aid, "From motives of humanity and from a wish to be better informed of the interior State of Assam, its commerce, etc." Lord Cornwallis despatched under Captain Welsh in 1792 six companies of troops to Assam.* Soon Kamrup was cleared of the Burkandazes, and the resistance of the Moamarias collapsed in Upper Assam. Hardly had Welsh restored law and order in the territory and entered into a commercial treaty with Raja Gaurinath (28 February 1793), when there occurred a radical change in the policy of the government. Sir John Shore, the new Governor-General, resorted to the policy of non-intervention and consequently troops under Welsh had to be recalled from Assam.
Despite importunities of Gaurinath and his subjects British troops were withdrawn in July 1794 and Assam relapsed to her former state of anarchy and misrule. The Burkandazes reappeared and renewed their depredations in Kamrup and Darrang. Internal strife and growing imbecility of the rulers enabled the vassal chiefs and officers of the government to assume virtual independence. The Moamarias raised their heads and became so powerful that their chief Matibar had to be acknowledged as the head of the tribe by the Ahom government with the title of the Barsenapati. The Singphos from their settlements on this side of the Patkais gradually advanced and, before long, made the whole tract east of the nver Buridihing their sole preserve. The Khamtis who had already established themselves on the bank of the river Tengapani virtually usurped the authority of the Sadiya Khowa Gohain, the Ahom Viceroy in the eastern frontier, and reduced the non-Khamtis to the position of mere slaves.
During the reign of Kamaleswar (1795-1811) and Chandrakanta (1811-8), the successors of Gaurinath, the Ahom monarchy showed little sign of its vitality and strength. To

INTRODUCTION
make matters worse, under Chandrakanta the Court was divided into two hostile camps-the king and the members of the royal family on the one side, Purnananda Buragohain, the Prime Minister and his supporters on the other. The royalists, being unable to drive the domineering Buragohain from power had not the least hesitation in inviting foreign aid and they succeeded in persuading the Burmese Monarch to despatch a force into Assam. In 1817 the Burmese appeared on the scene, crushed all opposition, installed Raja Chandrakanta in full power and returned with a huge indemnity and an Ahom princess as a present to the Burmese Monarch. Reaction followed soon. Chandrakanta was deposed and mutilated and Purandar, another scion of the royal family, was raised to the throne. When these developments reached the ears of the Burmesc King, he despatched Ala Mingi at the head of another Burmese force which entered into the Assam frontier in February 1819. After a feeble resistance Purandar fled to Gauhati and thence took refuge in Company's territory. Chandrakanta though reinstated found the Burmese to be dangerous allies; for they now determined to rule over Assam themselves. Without any hope of succour and in utter disgust Chandrakanta, too, entered into Company's territory. Assam thus passed under the rule of the Burmese who placed Jogeswar Singha, a puppet on the throne.
The Burmese unleashed a reign of terror-plunder, devastation, murder and desecration became the order of the day. The dreadful atrocities perpetrated on the helpless Assamese could better be imagined than described. Butler writes :
All who were suspected of being inimical to the reign of terror were seized and bound by Burmese executioners, who cut off the lobes of the poor victim's ears and choice portions of the body, such as the points of the shoulders, and (they) actually ate the raw flesh before the living sufferers; they then inhumanely inflicted gashes on the body, (so) that the mutilated might die slowly, and finally closed the tragedy by disembowelling the wretched victims †.

<content>First Anglo-Burmese War
No consideration whatever was shown to age, sex and rank. In the words of Maniram Dewan (1806-58), an eyewitness of the outrages,
It was dangerous for a beautiful woman to meet a Burmese even in the public road. Brahmans were made to carry loads of beef, pork and wine. The Gossains were robbed of all their possessions. Fathers of damsels whom the Burmese took to wives lose speedily to affluence and power.*
Gangs of local marauders and neighbouring hill tribes, particularly the Khamtis and the Singphos, having identified their interests with the invaders carried on their depredations with fire and sword, plundering temples, ravaging the country and carrying off thousands of inhabitants into slavery. It is impossible to estimate the number of persons who fled, or were killed or deported to Burma. There was wholesale depopulation, industry collapsed, agriculture was neglected and trade, if any, was at a standstill.
Apparently the Burmese intervention in the affairs of Assam had been occasioned by the political bankruptcy of the Ahom monarch, but the real clause lay in the ambition of the Court of Amarapura to extend its dominion as far as the valley of the Brahmaputra. The process began with the reign of A-Laung-Pa-Ya (1752-60) when a portion of Manipur was annexed to Burma. In the war of succession which broke out in 1812 amongst the Manipuri brothers-Chaurjit, Marjit and Gambhir Singh-the Burmese intervened and set-up Marjit as the ruler under the suzerainty of the king of Ava. The remaining brothers fell upon Cachar driving its ruler Gobinda Chandra to seek protection under the British government. The rapid strides made by the Burmese in the North-East frontier and their threatening attitude could not but perturb the authorities in Calcutta. Burmese occupation of the island of Shahpuri, then under British possession, in November 1823 made it clear that they were "bent on invading British territory". The vulnerability of the eastern frontier demanded

INTRODUCTION
abandonment of the earlier policy of non-intervention and encouragement of the Assamese and the frontier tribes to resist and shake off the Burmese yoke. Accordingly David Scott, Agent to the Governor-General, North-East Frontier, extended British suzerainty over Cachar under an agreement with Raja Gobinda Chandra in early March 1824 lest his territory would afford the Burmese a base of operation, and Raja Ram Singh of Jayantia followed suit. In the meantime, on the plea of restoring the rightful claimant to the throne when the Burmese had converged on Cachar from three directions, Lord Amherst, the Governor-General, had no alternative but to declare war against Ava on 31 March 1825.
It is beyond our purview to narrate the details of the first Anglo-Burmese war which broke out in three sectorsAssam, Arakan and Rangoon. In the Brahmaputra valley, the war began with the advance of the British troops both by land and water under Lieutenant Colonel George McMoraine and Colonel Richards; and in less than three months time the Burmese were routed from Raha, Nowgong and Kaliabor. But the advancing columns rolled back with the Monsoon which had enabled the enemy to reoccupy their lost possessions. In the meantime, after a feeble resistance, the Burmese abandoned their posts in Cachar and fell back upon Manipur from which they were finally driven out by Gambhir Singh, the Manipuri prince, with his irregulars the Manipuri Levy. When the war was renewed in the Assam Valley after the rains, the Burmese beat a hasty retreat and were compelled to capitulate at Rangpur on 31 March 1825. The subsequent operations against the Khamtis and the Singphos conducted under Captain Neufville resulted in the pacification of the eastern frontier and the emancipation of several thousands of Assamese captives. But for the timely intervention of the British, Assam would have been converted into a Burmese province, or parcelled out amongst the hill tribes on the north and the south.

<content>CHAPTER ONE
The New Regime
At the treaty of Yandabo, 26 February 1826, His Majesty, the King of Ava surrendered amongst others his claim over Assam and the neighbouring States of Cachar, Jayantia and Manipur to the British government. By right of conquest these territories might be brought directly under the control of the government. But the authorities in Calcutta were then haunted so much by the bogey of another war with Burma that they had no alternative but to continue the policy of conciliating the neighbouring chiefs and tribes as far as practicable. Already in 1824 David Scott, the Agent to the Governor-General, NorthEast Frontier, had entered into an alliance with Raja Gobinda Chandra of Cachar under which in return for British protection, the latter undertook to pay tribute of rupees ten thousand per annum.¹ Raja Ram Singh of Jayantia, too, in his agreement with Scott acknowledged the authority of the British government, but no contribution or tribute of any kind was demanded of him. Later, Gambhir Singh, the Raja of Manipur, was not only vested with the powers of a sovereign ruler, but allowed to maintain an army, three thousand strong, to be trained and equipped by the British government: "The establishment of an independent Government of Manipur in alliance with us would undoubtedly prove to be most powerful and effective check upon the Burmese Government."³

In the south-east, to ensure security of the frontier Scott entered into agreement with several chiefs of the Singphos ; the latter bound themselves to obey the commands of the

government and not to carry on their predatory raids on British subjects nor to assist the invader on the other side of the hills. Salan Sadiya Khowa Gohain, the Khamti chief, and Matibar Barsenapati, the Chief of the Muttocks or the Moamarias, in their separate engagements undertook to furnish labour and militiamen in any emergency.¹
With none of the members of the Ahom royal family Scott entered into any alliance or negotiations on the eve of or during the war with Burma; yet he sought to pursue the same policy, in view of the assurance given by George Swinton, Secretary Government of India, in a despatch on 20 February 1824 that "the Governor-General in Council does not contemplate the permanent annexation of any part of it (Assam) to the British dominion".5 He proposed in a letter on 15 April 1826 the restoration of Ahom monarchy in Assam on a tributary basis under the protection of the British government and alternately, to retain Lower Assam as far as Bishwanath as a part of the British dominion, making over the rest of the territory with the exception of areas occupied by the Muttocks, the Khamtis and the Singphos to an Ahom prince. This was unacceptable to the Governor-General in Council inasmuch as the proposal envisaged extension of British protectorate over areas, the resources of which were yet to be ascertained. In a revised proposal next year "with due consideration of security and economy", Scott recommended that Lower Assam be annexed permanently to British dominion, while Upper Assam, the territory from Bishwanath to the river Buridihing, be placed under an Ahom prince on terms to be specifically laid down." Emphasising the importance of conciliating the Ahom nobility Scott brought home to the Supreme Government that the introduction of the British rule in Upper Assam would be productive of great resentment and discontent amongst the former official aristocracy. Apart from this, the annexation of Upper

Assam would be uneconomic; the greater part of its revenue, estimated then at about a lakh of rupees, would have to be expended for providing for the members of the former royal family and grandees of the realm. Lower Assam, on the other hand, yielded a revenue of more than three lakhs of rupees. Administered, as it was, by the Viceroy at Gauhati (the Barphukan) almost independently, this part of the territory was never amalgamated to the rest of the Ahom kingdom and its inhabitants, too, Scott felt, would not have the same aversion to the rule of the British; "rather they might prefer them to their former masters who were reported to have humiliated and heaped upon them all sorts of indignities”. Scott, of course, proposed that the territory in the further east occupied by the Muttocks, the Khamtis and the Singphos be placed under a European Officer stationed at Bishwanath.8
The authorities in Calcutta examined the whole issue from the economic point of view. Lower Assam would yield a revenue upwards of three lakhs of rupees and its inhabitants, too, had little attachment to their erstwhile rulers. In their proceedings on 7 March 1828, they accorded their approval to Scott's proposal of permanent annexation of Lower Assam." They also agreed to station an officer in or near the areas occupied by the Muttocks, the Khamtis and the Singphos. Captain Neufville who had in the meantime acquired an intimate knowledge of the affairs of these tribes was made the Political Agent, Upper Assam, with headquarters at Bishwanath.10 Without further examination, they were, however, not inclined to surrender Upper Assam to an Ahom prince since "none of the aspirants did afford to the British aid during the last war which would establish the slightest claim to a remuneration of any part of their right by conquest". The revenues of Upper Assam, too, it was argued, were fluctuating and under better management it was expected to yield

a surplus even after making adequate provision for the members of the royal families and dignitaries of the realm. Above all, it was feared, that the British government would be responsible for the general defence and protection against internal commotion or external aggressions.¹¹
Thus the process began, though slowly, for the extension of British dominion into Assam or the North-East Frontier. The people submitted to the inevitable; in fact, they "hailed with unbounded joy" their deliverers who saved them from the tyranny of the Burmese, and offered them the most loyal cooperation. Even Maniram Dewan, later an arch-enemy of the British, heartily welcomed the advent of the English :
The Sarkar Bahadur having vanquished the Burmese occupied the Killa (fort) of Rangpur, and brought the whole country of Assa n under their subjection. As the reward of this pious action i rescuing the people of Assam from the sea of Burmese troubles, may God continue their uninterrupted and undiminished sovereignty till the end of Kalpa (i.e., 4,4,320,000,000 years) and make them as vigorous and powerful as the Lord of Amarawati (i.e., Indra &amp;gt; and ever-glorious like the Priyavrata Raja (a mythical king )12.
Arrangements had to be made before long for the collection of revenue and administration of justice in areas brought under direct control or sphere of British influence. Scott was convinced of the utmost importance of adopting the new administrative measures as closely as possible to the actual wants, prejudices and conditions of the people and specially of continuing to employ the leading men of the country in the discharge of duties of the hereditary offices subject to the supervision of European officers. He based his revenue measures on the earlier khel system* making only such alterations as were considered absolutely necessary. In Upper

Early Administrative Arrangements
Assam the khels were retained in tact. In lieu of personal service and produce, revenues were then demanded in cash. Janardan Barbarua, a man of rank, was placed in charge of the revenue department. He was to be aided in his duties by the Kheldars-Hazarikas, Saikias and Borahs.13 In Lower Assam or Kamrup, then divided into twenty-six parganas, settlements were made with the Choudhuries who were entitled during their term of office to rent-free grants besides the services of a number of pykes. They had no claim to property in the soil or to produce and were liable to be removed at the pleasure of the government.¹ In 1824-25 Nowgong and Raha, which formed a separate fiscal unit, was placed under two Farmers of Revenue-Aradhan Roy and Lata Pani Phukan. In the same year Scott entered into a settlement with Raja Bijaynarayan of Darrang on his agreeing to pay a revenue of Rs. 42,000.15
11
In Upper Assam with the exception of a poll-tax of rupees three per head no tax was levied whereas in Lower and Central Assam (Darrang, Nowgong and Raha) a tax of rupees two (gadhan) was imposed on pykes for which they were entitled to two puras of land each. In addition they were required to pay a poll-tax at varying rates under different names.16 In both the divisions professional tax on braziers,
his produce and in return he was entitled to have two puras of arable land. The pykes were supervised by kheldars or heads of khels-Borahs, Saikias, Hazarikas, Baruahs and Phukans-all being remunerated with the services of pykes besides grants of rent-free lands.

gold-washers, fishermen etc. and duties on hats, ghats and fisheries continued to be levied as under the former government. Above all the rent-free grants- debottar, dharmottar and brahmottar-hitherto exempted from taxation, were under assessment.¹ 17
For the administration of civil justice, in Upper Assam, Lambodar Barphukan, a brother-in-law of ex-raja Chandra Kanta Singha, was appointed coadjutor with Janardan Barbaruah of the revenue department.¹ To decide cases of minor importance surrasurree panchayats were set up while criminal cases were tried by the Political Agent or referred to the Court of Barphukan. Trial of cases demanding capital punishment or long-term imprisonment was held before juries presided over by the Barphukan subject, of course, to the supervision of the Commissioner of Assam. 19
In Lower Assam the Commissioner aided by Adam White, his Assistant at Gauhati, tried civil cases without limit and criminal cases not involving sentences of death.20 Towards the close of 1826, when it became physically impossible on the part of the Commissioner to dispose of all the cases with promptitude to meet the ends of justice, three native tribunals were set up at Gauhati. Of these the first, the Rajkhowa's Court, decided cases of minor importance; the second under a Barphukan tried civil cases to the extent of rupees one thousand and to hear appeals from the lower court. The third under another Barphukan decided criminal cases and appeals from the Choudhuries and other revenue officials who were also empowered, as before, to exercise judicial authority in their respective jurisdictions.21 To relieve concentration of judicial business at the headquarters, a number of mofussil panchayats, with elected members were set up at populous

It appears from official reports that after British occupation the number of crimes was on the increase in Assam. Apart from ordinary theft, cattle lifting, elopement of girls, cases of burglary, highway and gang robberies hitherto uncommon were of frequent occurrence. The increase in the number of crimes may be attributed partly to the disuse of capital and severe corporal punishments as under the previous government but mainly to the absence of police to protect the lives and properties in the interior. "The introduction, of a perfect or even tolerably efficient police", Neufville admitted, "in a country like Assam is altogether out of our

power that for a considerable period, at least, its effective operation must be confined to a certain distance round the sadar station."²21 As a matter of fact, a police establishment consisting of a daroga, a jamadar and a few constables was maintained at the headquarters, but mofussil police was left entirely in the hands of the choudhuries, patgiris and other revenue officers. 25
•
In the actual working of the new measures, revenue and judicial, Scott was disillusioned. He was greatly disappointed to find that the commutation of the services of the pykes failed to produce "either an adequate pccuniary collection to the government or satisfaction to the people".26 The reasons were not far to seek. The general survey subsequently conducted revealed that two-thirds of the land remained fallow ; of the arable portion again, about one-fifth was held under rent-free grants. Remissions had to be granted, frequently, on account of mofussil collection, desertion of ryots, mistakes, etc. Above all taxes in the pargatas of Kamrup were hitherto

so low that despite existing rates being doubled, the net revenue hardly reached Scott's figures.27 Convinced of the impossibility of raising the existing rates any further, Scott directed his attention to tapping new sources of revenue. Poll-tax (kharikatana) was now extended in Kamrup to all classes of people including the slaves.28 Pykes were given an additional allotment as gamati or bodyland at a rate of annas seven per pura. * They were further required to pay 6%% on the gross collection to the choudhury for mofussil expenses, 1% to the treasurer for profit and loss, %2% as commission, 12% to 37% % as a barangani to cover the expenses of police and contingencies besides interests and fines for dilatory payment: "Even persons of intelligence would be puzzled to say how much a ryot would have to pay to the government. To the unfortunate peasants the account must have been wholly incomprehensible."2⁹
.
What was worse, tracts of territories had been allotted to a single individual namely the choudhury by a method which was more of the nature of a "sale by auction". No effective check was taken to protect the ryots from his extortions nor was any accurate account taken of the collections actually made.30 In theory, the choudhury was to be elected by the people, but in practice not only did he bribe the people by false promises and even by money, but he resorted to the same method among the amlahs at the sadar station and this amount together with the revenue and a profit to himself were afterwards exacted from the ryots. Moreover foreseeing the possibility of not being re-clected and determined to make as much (money) as possible during the period he exacted on all sides sometimes five or six times the real amount of rent collected.31 No wonder, therefore, "the existing system", in the words of a contemporary,

has been harmful in the extreme.

Inevitably
villages once the most flourishing are now deserted and in ruins; the inhabitants instead of finding the British government a power which would protect them with enjoyment of their hearths and homes, have fled by hundreds in all directions, not only to the neighbouring zamindaris of Bengal, but what is more painful to contemplate, to the lawless regions of Bootan."
33
Equally deplorable was the condition in Central Assam. Settlements were made in different areas mostly with nonresidents without any consideration of the resources of the country or of the ryots. Innumerable extra cesses were levied, as in Lower Assam, when even the stipulated revenue could not be realised. The evils of the system were aggravated by an abrupt change from a demand of revenue in kind to an exaction in cash at a time when no trade existed by which the ryots could dispose of their commodities. The introduction of money as the medium of exchange without a substantial increase in the existing currency inevitably fell crushingly on the ryots for whom there was no alternative but to leave their hearths and homes to find shelter even in the adjoining hills.34
Despite universal extortion and oppression, the ryots scarcely resorted to the courts of law for the redress of their grievances. The civil cases in the first instance being entirely left to the local tribunals subject to the remote supervision of a European functionary hardly met the ends of justice.35 The number of mofussil courts was few and far between and the accumulation of business at Gauhati rendered it difficult

for the outlying areas to obtain speedy justice. Above all, the sadar courts were reported to be corrupt in the extreme. In fact, the courts and panchayats at Gauhati were held by the people in such distrust and detestation that they preferred to submit to anything rather than to seek redress at these courts; "for it was not uncommon that the presenting of a complaint was more injurious than putting up with the original case."36

The situation in Upper Assam was no less alarming. For the successful working of the khel system, all the members of a particular khel (say sonowals) should reside as closely as possible. In fact under the Ahom rulers they were located in a given tract of territory with definite boundaries. The unparalleled deaths and desertions in the wake of Burmese invasions led to such a mixing up of pykes of different units that the khels became misnomers and their organisation was one of confusion worse confounded. Even to a man of experience it became impossible to do justice to the inhabitants of the khels scattering from the river Dikhow to the Dhansiri and from the Lohit to the Dayang. To effect speedy collection kheldurs had resorted to a host of petty agents of heterogenous elements whose only concern was to collect as much as they could by fleecing the ryots. During 1826-8, a considerable amount of collection never reached the treasury. The revenue of Upper Assam for the year 1827-8 could not meet even the charges of establishment. In the meantiine ruthless extortion led the unfortunate ryots to migrate into the territory of Muttocks where taxation was nil or nominal.37
The harrowing tales of the affairs of Assam could not but draw the attention of the authorities in England. "It unfortunately appears certain" remarked the Court,
from whatever cause, we have hitherto governed Assam extremely ill... the country has been retrograding, its inhabitants emigrating,

This deplorable state of affairs, in the opinion of the Court of Directors, amply demonstrated "want of foresight" hitherto displayed in the administrative arrangements. The GovernorGeneral was therefore directed to lose no time in framing a plan of administration providing adequate securities "for integrity and efficiency" in the subordinate agents of the government.39

Anti-British Movements: Early Phase
To his utter disappointment Scott found before long that the men of rank proved themselves wholly incompetent to discharge the duties of the revenue and judicial departments entrusted to them. They were placed under a novel system of administration to which they had been quite strangers. Hitherto written documents were not much in use and writing was not essential to most of the public functionaries.* They were now amazed at the mass of writings in which even the most insignificant transactions of the government were conducted and naturally they proved themselves incapable of furnishing those voluminous and infinite details required of them. Consequently, "their very presence caused great labour and trouble to the European functionaries".¹ There were also cases of embezzlement in money apart from oppression and extortion of the ryots. Janardan Barbaruah had to be dismissed for he was found guilty of defalcation of a huge amount.² His successors, too, proved useless and, therefore, shared the same fate. "Owing to the indolent and incapable conduct of the nobility and the impossibility of extracting money without the use of duress" the local authorities had no other alternative but to resort to the employment, in lieu of "men of rank", "men of ability and business", mostly from
*In fact, people considered it "derogatory or unnecessary to educate their offsprings, unless their forefathers were of the class called the kaguttees". Consequently, "very few of the higher classes can either read or write, and (they) retain a kaguttee or writer to transact their business". Matthie to Jenkins 9 June 1834; AS., vol. 4a, 1834.

Gomdhar Konwar: His attempted Coup
the neighbouring districts of Bengal, lest they had to "relinquish all hope of realising government dues".³
Scott's policy of conciliating the former official aristocracy thus proved a dismal failure. He provided some of them with jobs under the government, a few others with pensions, gratuities and rent free grants; but the number of beneficiaries was extremely small. The Have-nots now pinned their faith on restoration of the old regime which would retrieve their fortunes. Herein, too, they were greatly disappointed; they doubted the real motives of the government when the matter was unduly delayed. To their mortification they now found their kith and kin thrown out of employment. Those who had "a vested right to office" were elbowed out by a number of "interlopers from below". The abrupt change in policy produced irritation and resentment of the upper classes who instinctively felt that their future was extremely bleak under the alien government. No wonder, therefore, they made repeated attempts to overthrow the British government and to place a ruler of their own in Upper Assam.
Towards the close of 1828, a group of nobles headed by Dhanjoy Bargohain, a former officer of rank, took up the cause of Gomdhar Konwar, a scion of Ahom royal family.¹ The time was highly opportune. The Khasis under Terrut Singh were then maturing plans to expel the British from their hills. The Singphos in the south-east were also restive; they were bidding time and waiting for an opportunity to attack the enemy. At the same time the Bhutias in the north were committing aggressions on the British subjects. Rumours were afloat that the Regular troops which were on service during the period of the late war would depart from Assam leaving the defence of the province in the hands of local corps. Not unreasonably the rebels thought that it would not be difficult on their part to occupy Rangpur, the former capital of the

Ahom government, by driving out the few war-broken soldiers that might be left there on guard.
At Bassa, in the south-east corner of Jorhat, Gomdhar was formally enthroned and was vested with white shoes and the umbrella, the insignia of royalty. The bailungs or the priests performed the rituals. Brisk preparations were made to march against the English by recruiting men, collecting arms and levying contributions. In the last week of November 1828, in order to concert measures with their collaborators at the headquarters the rebels advanced towards. Mariani, twelve miles from Jorhat, where they were intercepted by a detachment under Lieutenant Rutherford. After a feeble resistance Gomdhar fled into the Naga hills and most of his followers fell into the hands of the detachment. The fugitive prince after roaming a few days in the jungles and being completely frustrated in his attempts surrendered himself to Rutherford. The secret documents which were discovered in his possession proved the complicity of Dhanjoy and his son, and both of them were immediately apprehended."
Gomdhar strongly denied before the panchayat at Jorhat that he had any wish to wage war against the Company. All that he wanted was, as it appears from the deposition of some witnesses, a kingship on a tributary basis under the protection of the government. When he was on his way to Jorhat to plead his case personally before the Political Agent, the rebels goaded him into action against the British government. In consideration of the fact that he was a mere tool in the hands of a number of designing people, the Agent to the GovernorGeneral commuted the capital punishment awarded to him by the panchayat to an imprisonment for a period of seven years. Dhanjoy being found guilty of abetting and aiding

Uprisings of the Khasis
the rebellion was sentenced to death, but he managed to escape from the jail and penetrated into the Naga hills.
British occupation of Lower Assam could not but be viewed with serious concern by the Khasi chiefs who held the lowlands, commonly known as Naduar or nine duars, north of their hills. These chiefs were allowed by the former government to occupy the duars subject to their homage, good behaviour and payment of nominal rent in kind. On account of their complicity in the Burmese war several chiefs lost their possessions. With the rest Scott entered into settlemeut in 1825 for fixed demands in money. An assessment based on no certain data and with the scarcity of the circulating medium in a region where barter was the only medium of exchange resulted in wholesale arrears. Consequently Collectors had to be changed one after another and in some cases duars were brought directly under the government. Within a few years, the Khasis saw that they were deprived of their low-lands so indispensable for supply of their daily necessaries, and in fact starvation stared them in their faces. Independent in bearing, exclusive in spirit, the proud mountaineers were not prepared to submit to the English without a challege. The initiative was taken by Barmanik, the ruler of Khyrem, who in August 1828 descending down upon the plains of Dimarua, a few miles from Gauhati, levied contributions, seized collections made by the revenue officers and publicly declared that in the next winter he would reoccupy
the duars.⁹
The credit of organising a war of liberation, however, goes to Terrut Singh, the Raja of Nungklow. In November 1826, as the price of mediation in his disputed succession, the chief entered into an engagement with Scott under which amongst others he agreed to acknowledge the authority of the British government and to provide a route for passage of British troops

through his territory.10 The subsequent improvements in the road, the erection of police post and a convalescence camp at Nungklow incurred the displeasure and even enmity of his neighbours; for, these developments, they not unreasonably thought, were prelude to the establishment of British authority in the hills.¹¹ The Raja of Nungklow, however, hoped that he would have support and backing of the English even with military aid whenever needed and in any case he would have unrestricted privileges over the duars without payment of any revenue whatsoever. In his dialogue with Mohadhar Baruah, the superintendent of the border areas, Terrut said :
Barooah ! Mr. Scott formerly made friendship with me saying "your enemy is Company's enemy" and that he would reliquish the Burdowar Revenue, both in money and pykes. He has not done it and he has the wish to give troops to my enemy, the Ranee Rajah. 12
This was a betrayal of trust, thought the unsophisticated hill chief. He was, therefore, no longer bound by the treaty. This was followed by the massacre at Nungklow on 4 April 1829 wherein the Khasis under Terrut burnt down the convalescence camp, set free the convicts employed in the construction of road and hacked to pieces several men including Bedingfield and Burlton, two British officers who had been there for the recovery of health. 13 Nothing short of expulsion of the English was their ultimate objective, after the attainment of which their plans envisaged political combination of the most extended nature; having selected the most intelligent and trusted agents, “he (Terrut) had sent them off with letters to Chandrakant, the Bhots, the Singphos exciting them to throw off the yoke of the English". In a message to ex-raja Chandrakanta it was written :

The country of the Rajah have (been) taken possession of by the English. We have been greatly annoyed. We have now killed the English gentlemen here. Should the Rajah now rise and assist us we can with the Garrow people descend (from) the hills.15
To enlist the sympathy and support of the few Assamese then at their custody the aged queen (Ranee), supposed to be the aunt of Terrut, said:
I have called on you my sons. Be under no apprehension for your lives. What was to be done with the Bengalces is done. I shall cut off the Agent's head and hang it up in Nungklow and then proceed to take Gauhati.1
The immediate objective of the insurgents was to prevent supplies and reinforcements from reaching Scott who was then at Cherrapunji. It was planned that Barmanik would guard the passes in the north while Terrut would effect a combination with Makund Singh, the chief of Mosmy at Mumlo with a view to intimidating the people of Cherra then friendly with the British, which would enable them to expel the small party under Scott.¹7 The position of the English at Gauhati was also far from being secure; only a few weeks before, the Regular troops had been withdrawn from Assam and the defence of the frontier was left in the hands of the scattered but limited number of detachment of the Assam Light Infantry. To make matters worse, the movement of troops was rendered extremely difficult for the communication had already been cut off by the rebels by destroying bridges, obstructing the roads and raising palisades.18
Despite overwhelming odds, Captain Lister, the Commandant of the Sylhet Light Infantry, hurriedly arrived at Mumlo before its occupation by the insurgents under Terrut.¹" Mamlo was burnt to the ground and Terrut had to flee for his

life carrying a reward of rupees one thounsand over his head. Dewan Singh, the Cherra Raja, volunteered his services; Singh Manik of Khyrem and Raja of Nuspung followed suit.20 On 23 April Scott joined the detachment under Lister who had since reduced the chief of Lynkuncho, a vassal of Terrut, and occupied in rapid succession Lungbree, Myrong and Nongkrem. The Khasis could offer but feeble resistance to the advancing parties under Scott who pushed their way through burning villages and in early May entered into Nungklow. Mylliem also fell in the same month and Barmanik sued for peace. 21 Towards the close of 1829 the hard core of the rebels broke down, but the desultory warfare continued till the surrender of Terrut in June 1832.*
ANTI-BRITISH MOVEMENTS : EARLY PHASE
In the meanwhile, eluding the vigilance of the police authorities Dhanjoy entered into Legee, a village in the territory of the Moamarias, and made preparations for an uprising on a "grand scale".22 Besides his sons Harakanta and Hemanath and son-in-law Jeuram Dihingia Baruah, Peali, son of Badan Barphukan, ex-viceroy of Gauhati, Rupchand Konwar(?), Boom Singpho and several others joined the enterprise organised by the Bargohain. Emissaries with secret letters were sent out to the Chiefs of the Moamarias, the Khamtis, the Singphos, the Khasis, the Garos and the Nagas, calling upon their aid in expelling the English from Assam and the neighbouring territories.23 Invoking the aid of the Sadiya Khowa Gohain, the Khamti Chief, Peali wrote:

Simultaneously intelligence arrived of the hostile activities of the Singphos on either side of the Patkais under Wookum Khoomyan, a chief of Hukwang. The invaders made, as reported, elaborate preparations and acted in concert with the disaffected nobles of Assam. The situation appeared to be a serious one, but the timely arrival of Captain Neufville with a party of troops at L'attora on the Noadihing in the middle of February 1830 prevented the combined move of the enemies. The Singphos being unable to resist the volly of fire from the British camp made a hasty retreat beyond the hills.26
In the meantime after performing the Deo Puja, a ritual usually observed on such occasions, the rebels advanced towards Rangpur which was then poorly defended by a Jamadar with thirty sepoys.27 The failure of Wookum Khoomyan and lack of adequate response on the part of the neighbouring chiefs damped their spirits. What proved ultimately most fatal to their case was the betrayal of the Sadiya Khowa; the latter on 20 February seized and surrendered the rebel

Haranath to the Political Agent, Upper Assam. 28 In spite of these untoward events, on 25 February the rebels numbering about four hundred made a desperate attack on the post at Rangpur. They were repulsed and hotly pursued by the sepoys for a few days after which no trace of them could be found. A detachment of Assam Light Infantry was immediately sent against the enemy who then entrenched themselves at Geleki near the Charaideo hills. After a small encounter, the sepoys dispersed the rebels and succeeded in apprehending most of the ring leaders except Dhanjoy who penetrated again into the interior of the hills.25
29
The nobility utterly failed in offering a united front to their common enemy, and in fact, a section of them betrayed their cause. The people in general, too, were indifferent to the cause of the upper orders; rather they evinced a feeling of distrust and suspicion for their activities. The villagers of Sonowal, near Bassa, even refused to acknowledge the pretensions of Gomdhar unless he assured them that he had obtained the raj from the Company, and until he took an oath that he would not collect any revenue, would grant more lands and remove their hardships.30 With the memories of the anarchical conditions still fresh in their minds they were unprepared for any change in government which would endanger security of their lives and properties. Nevertheless the anti-British movements, though "chimerical in design and short-lived", as Neufville remarked, "created a (sic) most pernicious effect in unsettling the minds of the natives throughout Assam and tending much to throw them into that state of anarchy and confusion from which we have so lately relieved them"."

<content>Agreement with Purandar Singha
Peali, Jeuram, Haranath, Roopchand and Boom Singpho were tried by the panchayat under the Political Agent at Jorhat; and all of them being found guilty of treason and rebellion were sentenced to death. The Agent confirmed the verdict on Peali and Jetram and ordered them to be hanged without delay since deterrent punishment was considered absolutely necessary to stop recurrence of similar uprisings. For the rest, capital sentences were commuted to transportation for a term of fourteen years with confiscation of property. 32
27
The repeated uprisings and the administrative confusion of the period convinced the authorities in Calcutta that in spite of best of intentions it would not be possible on their part to ensure a government in Upper Assam as would be conducive to the well-being of all the classes.33 "It would be unreasonable to expect" remarked Scott in his last communication on the subject, "that the Ahom nobility and the members of the royal family whose predecessors ruled the country for several centuries would relinquish their ancient rights upon the appearance amongst them of a handful of strangers".34. It was found extremely difficult to absorb them under the government nor would it be possible to provide them all with pecuniary assistance when the revenues of the territory barely met the charges of the establishment. The administrative confusion demanded above all a change; for "An imperfect British Administration", as Scott rightly observed,
whether occasioned by a deficiency of European officers or by an adherence to customs that are incompatible with the spirit of our rule must be worse than a native one, which at least possesses a perfect knowledge of the laws, customs and prejudices of its subjects and an intimate acquaintance with their peculiar revenue system on which if it is to be inaintained in its present shape, so much depends.35

ANTI-BRITISH MOVEMENTS : EARLY PHASE
Lord William Bentinck, the Governor-General, reviewed the whole question from the utilitarian point of view-whether annexation or restoration of an Ahom prince would contribute to the greatest good to the government and the governed. He deprecated the policy of appeasement so persistently advocated by Scott since the territory was conquered from the Burmese without any aid from the ruling family; yet he agreed on the principle of restoration. He thought that a monarchy which had lasted without any break for more than six centuries might be "intrinsically good" and under the "support and advice" of a British officer might be conducive to the well-being of the people. The death of Scott delayed the decision of the government till October 1832 when it was finally resolved to assign Upper Assam to a member of the Ahom royal family who might conduct the administration to the satisfaction of all classes. Of the several claimants to the throne, the choice fell ultimately on Purandar Singha who was considered to be "the person best fitted to be at the head of the State".38
37
Under the terms of the agreement on 2 March 1832 Purandar bound himself inter alia to pay a tribute of rupees fifty thousand, to obey the orders of the Political Agent and to administer justice on the principles generally prevailed in company's territory.39 He shouldered the burdens of a country of doubtful value at a price that was too high. The tribute was not based on the actual resources of the country but fixed on guesswork. To outbid his rivals Purandar also undertook to collect the irrecoverable arrears of the British government besides the payment of annual nazaranas. Even the Court of Directors remarked: "It appears to us very doubtful whether this chief will be able to pay an annual tribute amounting to half of his gross revenue without involving himself in embarrassment."4⁰

Reorganisation, Resumptions and Annexations
T. C. Robertson succeeded Scott as the Agent to the Governor-General in April 1832. A man of tact, prudence and sound judgment the Agent apprised himself soon of the whole situation. He had felt that great injustice had already been done to this frontier province by reposing its responsibilities to a single functionary namely the Agent to the GovernorGeneral overburdened as he was with civil and criminal justice, settlement of revenue and multifarious activities of a far flung frontier. With his prejudice against the "native agency", Robertson realised that nothing could succeed in Assam without the supervision of European officers. On his recommendations in March 1833 the Supreme Government accorded its approval for the division of the province into four districts -Goalpara, Kamrup, Darrang and Nowgong; over each was placed a Principal Assistant (P.A.) vested with the powers of a Collector, Judge and Magistrate. He was to be aided in his duties by a Junior Assistant (J.A.) and in some cases SubAssistants (S.A.).¹ Captain White, who had succeeded to the office of the Political Agent on the death of Neufville in 1830, was also made the Commandant of the Assam Light Infantry at Bishwanath.²
In civil cases the Principal Assistant was to decide original suits from rupees five hundred to one thousand besides hearing appeals from Lower Courts; while in criminal cases he had the same authority as the Magistrate of Bengal; of course with the additional duties of investigating capital cases with the aid

of jury." In each district there were two other courts-the munsiff's court and the panchayats; the former vested with the powers of trying original suits from rupees one hundred to five hundred and the latter with the power of deciding cases of minor importance not exceeding rupees one hundred. The mofussil panchayats were abolished; the cases which were hitherto tried by these tribunals and also by the revenue officials were to be investigated hereafter by the panchayats at Gauhati and munsiff's court set up for the purpose at Bishwanath, Charduar, Naduar and Nowgong.1
REORGANISATION, RESUMPTIONS AND ANNEXATIONS
In revenue affairs, Robertson was not slow to realise that the existing disorders were due to "paucity of European officers", to the "ignorance of those employed of the resources of the country and the condition of the people", the demands "founded upon on no certain data", "irregular and undefined additional assessments", "corrupt practices and intrigues of the amlahs", "embezzlement by all parties" and so on.5 As a remedy, towards the close of 1832, among others, Robertson abolished additional imposts including the barangani and introduced in Darrang and some areas of Kamrup tax on land at varying rates from a rupee to rupecs one and a half. The ryots were required to pay in addition a capitation tax from rupee one to rupees three. As a security against extortion, revenue officers were required to furnish returns showing the name of the ryots, the quality and quantity of the land and the number of hearths and homes. After scrutiny, on the basis of these statements settlements were made directly with the ryots, and title deeds or pattas were issued to them specifying therein the amount of revenue to be paid under signature and seal of the Collector. The revenue officers-Choudhuries, Bishayas and Patgiris-became a number of local collectors receiving a remuneration varying from seven to fifteen per cent with limited duties to aid the district officers in the

assessment and collection of revenue in his jurisdiction. They were to be aided in their duties by patwaris (clerks), thakurias (mandals) and gaon kakaties (village accountants)."
The revenue was nowhere uniform nor equitably distributed. The taxes on one's caste and calling as well as the capitation, house and hearth taxes continued to be levied in spite of the opposition of the local authorities. The settlements were also made for a period not exceeding five years. Revenue officers seldom gained during their short term more than anything beyond the commission allowed to them and instances were not rare when many of them were subjected to heavy losses or utter ruin for circumstances beyond their control. No wonder they had little incentive to make any improvement in the land or to bring more areas under cultivation. Nevertheless in the words of Anandaram Dhekial Phukan, an eminent Assamese of the age, as a result of these
measures :
Every Ryot in Assam is the absolute master of his own lands from which he is never liable to be ousted until he relinquishes it out of his own free will. His liabilities too are ascertained under the immediate superintendence of the public Revenue authorities, and clearly laid down in the pattahs issued to him under the seal and signature of the collectors, so that any attempt at exaction is easily detected and restrained.8
In Upper Assam, too, the situation altered with the restoration of Ahom monarchy under Purandar Singha on
BRC., 1836; 1 March, No. 40 op.cit. ¡Ibid.
In
Thus in Kamrup the tax on rupit or first class land was a rupee per pura and on non-rupit or others from annas twelve to six.

24 April 1833. To win over the men of rank, the Raja revived the customs, traditions and institutions of his predecessors." With his administrative zeal, he reorganised the khels with well defined boundaries. After ascertaining the assets, settlements were made for a period of three years with the kheldars who were granted a commission on the gross collection besides services of a number of pykes.10 To meet the demands of the new administration, the heads of the khels were required to learn within a certain period, reading and writing and that schools were to be set up for the purpose under their supervision. For speedy justice the kheldars were authorised to try criminal cases involving a penalty to the extent of six months imprisonment and in civil cases not exceeding rupees ten besides hearing of complaints against irregularities of exactions of the amlahs. To decide minor cases, mofussit courts were set up at Rangpur, Majuli, North Lakhimpur, Bassa and Dayang. The Barbaruah's court had the power of awarding punishment to the extent of three years' imprisonment and of trying civil cases to the amount of rupees one thousand. The Supreme Court with the Raja as the President decided civil cases above rupees one thousand and all heinous crimes.¹2

From the very outset Purandar had to confront too many difficulties. The presence of the Barsenapati, the Muttock chief, in his neighbourhood without paying any tribute constituted a source of constant embarrassment. Emigration followed from Raja's territory to Muttocks where the ryots were required to pay little or no taxation. The attempt made by Adam White, the Political Agent, Upper Assam, in early 1835 to impose a tribute of rupees ten thousand on the Muttock chief ended in failure.13 The attitude of the Supreme Government to that chief was also one of "moderation"; since the

neutrality if not of active help of the Barsenapati with the sturdy Muttocks behind him was considered essential as long as the situation in Sadiya frontier continued to be unsatisfactory. Within his own territory Purandar failed to securo the sympathetic support of his subjects particularly of the nobility on whoin he counted much. Some of his measures, too, were ahead of the time. The mouzadari settlement which he introduced in certain areas reducing the number of fiscal units threw many of the former officials out of employment.¹ His regulation that if candidates with necessary educational qualifications were not forthcoming from the upper orders, the office would be thrown open to all, high and low, wounded the sentiments of those who had high hopes in his elevation. Far from improving their condition, the rule of Purandar had made the lot of the men of rank worse, and in utter disgust and despair they attempted to thwart him and even to overthrow him if an opportunity presented itself.¹ Purandar nevertheless received the support of Robertson who in eloquent terms reported:

.
Though many of the higher orders of the Assamese were discontented with his rule, yet we were sure to receive the most favourable accounts of his actions and all agree in admitting that he had hitherto (been) to the bulk of the people a mild and beneficient master
33
The situation took a new turn with the arrival of Francis Jenkins in April 1834 as the Commissioner and Agent to the Governor-General for Assam and North-East of Rangpur. In the beginning the Commissioner was no less sympathetic to the Raja and was convinced of the responsibility of the government to support him by all means practicable. He agreed with the Political Agent on the imperative necessity of putting a stop to the exodus to Muttock by placing the Barsenapati on the same tributary basis.¹7 The uncompromising attitude of

the nobility and their constant allegations about the Raja's oppressive act through anonymous letters poisoned his mind and made him believe that most of their grievances were genuine. He was constrained to remark: "Were we now free to choose whether it were better to take the government of the country immediately into our hands or to manage it through the intervention of a native ruler it is my decided opinion, that it should in every way (be) desirable to assume the direct management of that portion of the province."¹8
19
To make matters worse, Purandar could not keep up the agreement with the British government. Since 1835-6 there was a rapid fall in revenue and consequent arrears of tribute. ¹9 This may be attributed partly to the transfer of Naduar, a subdivision in Darrang, yielding a revenue of about rupces ten thousand and partly to the removal of civil and military establishments which had effectively checked recirculation of a considerable amount. The outbreak of cholera and a famine following it about this timc, resulted in hugo arrears. To aggravate the situation, in March 1836 capitation, house and hearth taxes as well as taxes on one's caste and calling were abolished in Lower and Central Assam. Though hailed as a boon by many, the measure hit the Raja hard; tax-ridden fishermen, braziers, weavers and gold washers of Upper Assam emigrated in hundreds to adjoining British districts. Though the representation which Purandar made either for a remission of the tribute or collection of the revenue on his behalf on account of the runaways received the strongest support of Captain White, the Political Agent, Upper Assam, it was turned down by the Commissioner as "totally inadmissible".2 To him real cause of the exodus and consequent fall in revenue must be the "exorbitant extortion" and "oppressive character" of his government.

was consistent in his support of Purandar's administration. In his subsequent report after reviewing various aspects of the Raja's administration, the Political Agent concluded that "it has worked as well as could have been expected"; that "it should have a fair trial" by reducing the tribute say to rupees thirty-six thousand for "it must be remembered that compared to his meagre resources Raja Purandar Singha had paid the highest amount of tribute in British India".23 Even these cogent and forceful arguments failed to produce any change in the mind of Jenkins who remained intransigent as before. All that he remarked was "Even a reduction of tribute would not operate otherwise than prolongation of existing evils."24
To have a personal knowledge of the affairs of the territory of Purandar, in early 1838, Jenkins visited Upper Assam. In his report on 3 April Jenkins attributed the wholesale emigration of the ryots to the collection of revenue due from the runaways from those who remained, the oppressive character of the transit duties, the exaction of undue services, the want of military protection, wholesale corruption and inefficiency at the courts of justice and maladministration in general in the Raja's territory. 25 He had to admit that emigration was also encouraged by lower rate of taxes in Muttock and by the entire abolition in Lower and Central Assam of the service of the pykes, the transit duties, and the poll tax. He recognised that he was given authority over a people of which masses were indifferent to frequent changes in government while the majority of the upper orders were opposed to him and were actually endeavouring to overthrow him. In consideration of the fact that "the misrule of the Raja was not entirely without excuse", Jenkins recommended partial resumption of Upper Assam allowing him continued possession of a part of territory that would yield a revenue adequate

to meet the demands of his government. 26 Curiously enough the Commissioner altered his mind overnight. Presuming that there was no future for this unfortunate country unless the Raja was removed altogether, in a demi-official letter next morning to H. T. Princep, Secretary to the Government of India in the Political Department, Jenkins recommended immediate resumption of Upper Assam.2

REORGANISATION, RESUMPTIONS AND ANNEXATIONS
"The experiment of monarchy had miserably failed" deplored the Vice President in Council and therefore "it would be improper to leave the territory in the hands of Raja Purandar Singha."28 Lord Auckland, the Governor-General, was prepared, "to leaving him in the enjoyment of some portion of his territory and in any case not inclined to take immediately so drastic a measure as dethronement". But when he was told that the Raja was guided mainly by "a lust for money", "to have been under the control of bad advisers", "to have a notion of government hateful to the Assamese" and above all under him "no really efficient can take place", the Governor-General had no alternative but to accord his approval to absolute resumption. It was indeed unfortunate that under the influence of a group of backbiters instead of taking an unbiased view of the whole situation the Commissioner had acted in a doubtful manner so as to hasten the ruin of the unfortunate monarch. Jenkins failed to realise that

Purandar was elevated to the throne on the strongest recommendations of his capabilities by his predecessors and after mature and protracted deliberation of as many as cight years by the authorities at the Fort William. He would have earned the gratitude of posterity had he afforded Purandar a "fair trial"the chance to reorganise the government. Instead of applying proper remedies Jenkins killed the sickman at his bed.30
Raja Gobinda Chandra of Cachar, like his counterpart in Upper Assam, had to confront enemies within and without.

<content>Annexation of Cachar and Territory under Tularam
The tribute of rupees ten thousand which he undertook to pay to the British was fixed on the assumption that the revenue derivable from Cachar would reach three lakhs of rupees.³1 Cachar possessed, undoubtedly, vast resources and its plains were extremely fertile; but it was ruined and depopulated during the period of invasions. To economisc expenditure, Gobinda Chandra not only reduced the number of Ministers and Judges but deprived the immunities and rent-free grants which the latter enjoyed from carly times.32 Every endeavour was made to collect arrears due from defaulters by distraints of property, confinement, and in case where land was abandond, by collective fine on the pargana to which they belonged. To augment the revenuc, additional taxes were levied for the cultivation of poppy, fruits and vegetables, wearing of gold ornaments, riding on a palanquin (dola) or having music at marriages or festivals. Apart from these unpopular measures,
in his endeavour to reorganise the administration, the Raja had to recruit a number of outsiders, mostly from Bengal. The Kacharis found themselves before long that they were losing influence in their own territory. In their utter disgust and disappointment many of them migrated to the neighbouring districts of Assam as well as of Bengal.³1
37
The persistent enmity of Gambhir Singh and Tularam Senapati, the hill chief of North Cachar, made the position of Gobinda Chandra wholly insecure. The Raja of Manipur was enabled not only to build up an army of three thousand strong, but was indirectly encouraged to commit acts of aggression on the territory of Cachar. Gambhir Singh pursued a policy of slow but steady penetration into the hill region

east of Cachar. He aimed at grabbing the whole of Cachar if an opportunity presented itself.35 The authority of Gobinda Chandra was challenged by Tularam, the son of Ratna Mala, reported to be a Manipuri slave girl and Kahi Das, a petty servant (Khidmatgar) of the ruling family of Cachar.* Gobinda Chandra hated Tularam as the son of a slave girl and treating him to be a usurper made several attempts to dislodge him from his hill possessions. In retaliation Tularam repeatedly raided the plains of Cachar compelling the people to flee for their lives beyond the hills.³6 In 1829 a compromise was effected between the two chiefs through the mediation of Scott; but scramble for power was sure to ensue after the death of Gobinda Chandra; for the blessings of a son was denied to him."7 Above all there lay the interest of the Paramount power; Cachar "would become (under better management) the granary of the surrounding region; and thus affording adequate supplies to the Manipurian country which is inhabited by a brave and sturdy race conduce to the security and tranquility of our North-East frontier".38

The authorities in Calcutta were in fact interested in effecting a settlement with the Raja before his death. Hardly had the negotiations begun under Scott when on 24 April 1830 Gobinda Chandra was murdered, as alleged, by a number of Manipuris under the orders of Gambhir Singh.³ As was anticipated, there arose several claimants to the throne. The claim of Indraprabha, the eldest queen, was turned down on the presumption that she was not acceptable to the immigrant Hindus on account of her illegitimate marriage with Krishna Chandra, the brother of the deceased ruler.

pretensions of Tularam were dismissed forthwith as he was looked down upon by the plainsmen as of "low origin". With respect to Gambhir Singh, it was felt impolitic by the Supreme Government to allow him to profit by a crime which was supposed to have been committed at his instigation. In the absence of any legitimate or suitable claimant, by a proclamation on 14 August 1832 the principality of Cachar was annexed to the British dominion. Lieutenant T. Fisher who was then in charge of the district was permanently placed as its Superintendent under the supervision of the Agent to the Governor-General, North-East Frontier.4¹
39
Tularam was allowed under an agreement in November 1834 undisturbed possession of greater part of his tract on the belief that this would form a bulwark against the incursion of the Nagas.12 Under the weak rule of Nakulram and Brajanath, the unworthy successors of the Senapati the territory was subjected to frequent raids of the Angami Nagas which made even the neighbouring British districts wholly insecure. In 1854, when Mills found that "the territory under its present management is a serious obstacle to the settlement of the Naga country", Lord Dalhousie resumed it as a part of the British dominion.4 43
That there occurred a definite change in the policy of the British government-that appetite came with cating-was evident in the transactions with the neighbouring State of Jayantia. In entering into agreement with Raja Ram Singh in March 1824, Scott was under the impression that the territory being inhabited by a "warrior race" would be of great help to the British in their operations against the Burmese. Scott was greatly disappointed; neither in the war with Ava nor in subsequent.operations against insurgent Khasis, the Raja's aid was up to the expectation of the local authorities.

on the otherhand, brought to the notice of the Government of Bengal that the Raja possessed besides the hills two fertile tracts "populous, well cultivated and capable of yielding a revenue
sufficient to maintain four or five companies of troops." "We have made a very unsatisfactory bargain", Fisher concluded, "in accepting a military service in place of tribute and sooner we amend the part of the treaty the better".44
The opportunity to revise the treaty soon presented itself. On 25 September 1832 Raja Ram Singh died and T. C. Robertson, the Agent to the Governor-General, lost no time in demanding from his successor Rajendra Singh, as the price of recognition by the British government, a new treaty under which he would be required to pay a tribute of rupees ten thousand." The Raja protested vehemently against the proposal. In his representation of 11 January 1834 to the Governor-General, Rajendra Singh prayed for exemption of the tribute on the ground of limited resources and recognition of past services of Jayantia; the payment of tribute, he pointed out, was in direct contravention of the agreement with Scotl.16 In reply the Chief was told that the treaty which his predecessor entered into with the British government was a "personal one" and that he would not be recognised until he bound himself to contribute to a part of general defence of the frontier. It was indeed unjust and impolitic to make a heavy demand of rupees ten thousand by a declaration that the treaty had become void by the death of the individual with whom it was contracted. "If there was no document", the Court of Directors observed, "to show that Jyantieah treaty was meant as a personal engagement liable to revision on the death of the Rajah we see no reason to assume that we are at liberty to consider it is annulled by that event.'

<content>Annexation of Jayantia
While the question of tribute was under consideration of the government, Rajendra Singh was implicated in a crime. In August 1832, four British subjects were seized at Gobha, a district of Jayantia; of which three were sacrificed before the goddess Kali.48 In 1821 when an attempt was made to carry off some British subjects for the purpose of immolating them Scott had warned Raja Ram Singh that a repetition of the crime would be followed by annexation of his territory. It was suspected that the atrocity was committed under the orders of Rajendra Singh who was believed to be a promoter of this horrible rite. Strangely enough, Robertson remained silent over the affair till the end of July 1833, exactly two months after the refusal of the Raja to enter into a new treaty and after this he sought to remove the Raja from the throne on his failure to arrest and deliver up the criminals. The Supreme Government was not disposed to act so hurriedly without further investigation.49 The enquiries which were subsequently made by Captain Jenkins could not conclusively prove the guilt of the Raja, yet the Governor-General in Council considered the case as "sufficiently proved" so as to warrant annexation of the territory under the warning given by Scott. Under resolution of the Government of India, 23 February 1835, the territories of the Raja in the lowlands were to be incorporated into the British dominion leaving the chief the hill possessions. Without any protest the Raja made over the entire territory since the resources of the hills would be extremely inadequate to support himself and his establishment.50
41
The proceedings of the Governor-General in Council could not but draw the attention of the Court of Directors at the Home. They stood opposed from the very beginning to the idea of imposing a tribute on the Raja as "an act of impropricty

and breach of good faith".51 The conduct of the Raja was not such, in their view, as to demand so drastic a measure as that of annexation. "The confiscation of his territory", the Court observed, "has always appeared to us a very summary measure of doubtful propriety". Since annexation has already been a fait accompli, the Court could do no more than directing the Governor-General to treat the "unfortunate chief" with "every reasonable indulgence" and to guard against over assessment or recurrence of such abuses as had (resulted) from the occupation of Assam.52 The wishes of the Court were respected more by the breach than observance as will be seen in a subsequent chapter.
Doubts had been entertained by the local authorities as to the fidelity of the Barsenapati and the Khamti chief, Sadiya Khowa Gohain. It was not unreasonable to suspect that the former had a secret hand in the uprising of the nobles in Upper Assam when one of his sons actively participated in the enterprise and making a part of his territory a rendezvous of the rebels.53 The Khamti chief was also supposed to have connived at, if not actively aided, the invaders on the other side of the Patkais.51 The two chiefs were unfortunately at loggerheads over their rival claims to the Upper Assam refugees who had settled themselves at Saikhowa, a tract just opposite to Sadiya. Despite specific instructions to submit their disputes to the arbitration of the Political Agent, towards the close of 1834 the Sadiya Khowa Gohain forcibly occupied Saikhowa, assaulted the settlers therein and acted in a manner calculated to incur the displeasure of the local authorities.5 Retribution quickly followed. Not only was the Sadiya Khowa Gohain dislodged from his office and later removed as an internee to Gauhati but his territory on either side of the river, Sadiya and Saikhowa, was brought under direct control of the

government.56 The Khamtis could hardly recorcile themselves to their lot; the smouldering ambers of the discontent lay dormant only to burst forth when an opportunity would present itself.
In 1835 the Barsenapati agreed to commute the services of the pykes for a payment of rupees eighteen hundred but he successfully opposed the move of the Political Agent to impose a tribute of rupees ten thousand; “if the Government was prepared to tax his subject, they must take the country into their own hands; he would rather go out than raise such a tax".57 The very presence of the Muttock chief with an exclusive spirit and an independent bearing was an affront to the local authorities. Tax-free Muttock continued to be the standing menace, as it encouraged hundreds of refugees to emigrate from the British districts. A revision of the treaty with the Barsenapati became all the more necessary to protect the interest of British speculators; Muttock had already attracted their attention as the best tea-growing district in Upper Assam. The death of the Barsenapati on 2 January 1839 afforded the Political Agent the much-desired opportunity to extract a new treaty from the Maju Gohain, the second son of the Senapati, who had in the meantime assumed charge of the territory. 58 A few days after, Captain White arrived at Rongagora, the headquarters of Muttock, and announced at the durbar or assembly that the British Government was prepared to recognise the chief on condition of his agreeing to enter into a new treaty under which he would be required to pay a higher tribute of rupees ten thousand. This was stoutly opposed by the Muttocks, and the Maju Gohain politely submitted that his subjects were too poor to bear any heavier taxation and that nothing but force would enable him to raise the demand. The Political Agent was convinced that there was hardly any prospect of raising a higher tribute than rupees two thousand five hundred. He considered it inexpedient to

antagonise the Muttocks so long as the situation in the Sadiya frontier continued to be unsatisfactory.59
The assassination of Captain White following the outbreak of the Khamtis and consequent insecurity of the frontier* diverted the attention of the local authorities from the affairs of the Muttocks. Although the Maju Gohain co-operated with the local authorities in the defensive measures, his bonafides were suspected throughout. "If he establishes a firm authority", Jenkins feared, "he would be the first to rise against us at any opportunity".60 Hamilton Vetch who succeeded White as the Political Agent, was not slow to realise that it would not be possible on the part of the chief to enter into an agreement against the wishes of his people. "I doubt", reported Vetch, "if we can hold the demand of rupees ten thousand without the risk of disaffection . . . but foregoing the demand without a fair equivalent would be attributed to weakness". The arrival of reinforcement towards the close of 1839 emboldened the Political Agent. The application of force was, however, unnecessary; for in the meantime Muttock was divided into two sectarian groups-the Muttocks and the Morans, and each under the guidance of its spiritual head (Gossain) aimed at dominating the other. The Morans, who formed the bulk of the population, preferred even the rule of the British to that of the Muttocks under the Maju Gohain."2 Having failed in his attempts to affect a compromise between the two rival groups, Vetch resolved on separation of the Morans from Muttock and to vest the existing incumbent with the management of his followers on his entering into a new agreement with the British government. On the refusal of the Maju Gohain or any of the chief to accept a truncated country, Vetch formally annexed the territory of the Muttocks and placed it under the jurisdiction of Principal Assistant, Lakhimpur.63

Defence of the North-East Frontier
The annexation of Muttock brought the whole valley of the Brahmaputra under direct control of the British government. The bogey of another war with Ava being removed and there remaining only forays of the border tribes to deal with, Regular troops were withdrawn from Assam in 1828 and the defence of the frontier was entrusted to the Assam Light Infantry, hitherto Rangpur local corps, with headquarters at Bishwanath and the contingents supplied by the chiefs of the Khamtis and the Muttocks." In 1835 to guard the northern frontier against the raids of the Duflas a body of irregulars, the Sebundis or the First Assam Sebundy was raised in Lower Assam.65 In the same year the Barsenapati commuted the services of the military pykes to payments in money; and the Sadiya Khowa followed suit. To guard the south-cast frontier, therefore, Captain Hannay raised in 1837 another levy of irregulars the Doaneah Militia at Jaypur composed mostly of recruits of mixed parentage of the Assamese and of the Singphos. The growing insecurity of the froutier in the wake of the revolt of the Khamtis in 1839 demanded the raising of a third local corps the Second Sebundis at Jaypur into which Doaneah Militia was absorbed.7 By providing employment to the inhabitants of the region, it was greatly hoped, to attach to the government warlike families of the Muttocks and the Doaneahs whose activities hitherto had been "a source of trouble and suspicion". The Doaneahs, however, found military service irksome and gradually withdrew from the regiment. In March 1844, the Second Sebundy corps was disbanded by reattaching the men to the First Assam Sebundy which was then converted into a local corps and renamed as Second Assam Light Infantry.68

A Non-Regulated Province under the Presidency of Fort William, Assam was placed since its annexation under administrative control of a Commissioner who had also the duties of the Agent to the Governor-Gencral, North-East Frontier. addition to the administration of civil and criminal justice, supervision of the collection of revenue, superintendent of police of the province, the Commissioner had to conduct political relations with the neighbouring states and chiefs-the sphere of jurisdiction extending to the southern extremity of Tipperah. Theoretically he was all powerful-he was not bound down by the letter of the Regulatlions.* In practice, for all acts beyond ordinary routine and all expenses above the sanctioned amount he was to obtain prior approval from the authorities in Calcutta. Delay was therefore unavoidable when every order however urgent had to emanate through proper channels from an authority over-burdened like that of the Government of Bengal. The dangers of too extensive jurisdiction being revealed during early administrative confusions, in January 1834, he was made the Commissioner and Agent to the Governor-General for Assam and North-East of Rangpur (Goalpara). For effective supervision, Sylhet was attached to the division of Dacca and separate arrangements
*The Bengal Regulations promulgated by Lord Cornwallis in 1793 provided a code of Regulations for the administration of the areas under the Presidency of Fort William. These Regulations were later considerd "wholly inapplicable" to backward areas like the North-East Frontier. Under Regulation X 1822 such areas were brought under an exccutive who was to conduct the administration "by the principles and spirit of the Regulations" subject to the modification hereafter provided, see Clark, R., Bengal Regulations Pp. 659-63.

<content>Commissioner and P.A.: Their Multifarious Duties
were made for the administration of Cachar, Manipur and Khasi Hills. To the relief of the Commissioner in 1839 the office of a Deputy Commissioner was created who was vested with the authority of a District and Sessions Judge. In spite of these developments Jenkins frankly admitted, "I have not been able to pay, at all times, that attention of (Sic) the departments which I would have wished."2 To discharge these duties he possessed neither a Secretariat nor even a team of capable Assistants. Owing to the dearth of duly qualified civil officers, district offices had to be filled up mostly by officers of the army liable to be recalled to the regiment at any moment depriving them thereby of the chances of acquiring experience and local knowledge indispensably necessary for civil duties. However well-intentioned they might be, their ignorance of the language, customs and usages rendered it difficult for them to do adequate justice to those under their jurisdiction.
 
Not the Commissioner alone, but the Principal Assistant later Deputy Commissioner of a district, was burdened with too many duties. In addition to the normal duties of a Collector, he had the functions of a Civil Judge, Superintendent of Police, Executive Engineer, Education Officer and also of a Post Master. Above all, each district had its border problems; district officers were to be ready at all times to proceed to the spot to make police enquiries or to conduct punitive expeditions against offending tribes. He was also expected to visit the neighbouring hills, from time to time, and endeavour through personal negotiations with the hill chiefs to remove the causes which had occasioned their hostilities.
In the administration of civil justice, the Principal sistant was vested with original jurisdiction of an unlimited extent and appeals from his court lay with the Commissioner and in "Special cases" with the Sadar Court. He was also empowered to transfer cases to the subordinate courts or to

withdraw any case from these tribunals and try them personally or refer to some other courts. Criminal cases continued to be tried, as before, by the Principal Assistant with or without a jury and in the event of any disagreement the proceedings were forwarded with necessary remarks to the Deputy Commissioner for final decision. Although the Junior Assistants were vested with the powers of a Deputy Magistrate in Bengal, the Sub-Assistants, Sadar Amins and Munsiffs or the "Native Judges" had only limited jurisdiction both in civil and criminal cases. Consequently cases accumulated in the files of the covenanted officers.
By their "justice, uprightness and impartiality" the European functionaries "had given more satisfaction to the people than the generality of the Native Judges".5 They could not administer justice arbitrarily, but by a uniform code of laws which made no distinction between the high and the low, the rich and the poor. But the Principal Assistant and those next to him were so much overwhelmed with cases and multifarious duties that it was physically impossible for them to meet the ends of justice. The Principal Assistant was required under the rules to examine the witness, particularly in criminal cases, by himself; but he recorded evidence only for a few days in a week and the duty was delegated usually to the amlahs— persons not duly qualified for the purpose.
In ninety cases out of one hundred the mohurir (amlah) is paid by the party at whose instance witnesses are summoned . . . In no instance has the examination of witnesses by the mohuris admitted of such injury as in criminal cases. The evidence for the prosecution is, generally, taken without the presence of the defendant or before he is summoned, and there is nobody to watch the examination. The mohurir puts down whatever he thinks best conducive to, the interest of the party who buys him over to his side.7

<content>Administration of Justice
Not only the judges but even the courts of law were not readily accessible. To reach the headquarters, the usual seat of justice, the aggrieved had to travel long distance, at places for days together carrying all the way for his subsistence the necessary quota of rice and other victuals. He could scarely expect to have on arrival an expeditious hearing of his case. As in other non-regulated areas, although under the rules justice should be administered in the "simplest way", parties. had to undergo even in trifling cases, a course of "vexatious and harassing procedure", and nobody knew how indefinitely one had to await a decision. Even if one was fortunate enough to obtain a decree in his favour, its execution was attended with so many obstacles that not unoften the complainant had to return home leaving his case to take its own course.8
The munsiffs and mofussil panchayats continued to function and decide civil cases in several districts in spite of their condemnation in the early years of administrative confusion. Even within their limited jurisdiction these tribunals could not decide cases according to their merit for the obvious reason that most of the functionaries were of "inferior ability, and seem to have been selected some on account of their respectability of character, others from political motive more than on account of their sagacity". Consequently in 1850 the number of cases decided by them was five in Kamrup, four in Nowgong, only one in Darrang; while in other districts they became obsolete.10
To protect the lives and properties in the interior there existed a police establishment, the thana, in charge of a thanadar or daroga. He was empowered to arrest suspected persons, to detain them and even to hold preliminary trials before sending them to sadar station. The revenue officers the choudhuries, patgiris and mouzadars-were expected to

assist him in the detection and apprehension of criminals. In practice, he was aided in his duties by a jamadar and a few constables although he had an extensive jurisdiction. usually over fifty miles. In the whole district of Nowgong, for instance, an area of over nine thousand square miles there existed only three thanas-Nowgong, Jagi and Hossang Hajo. This extensive jurisdiction in a country full of jungles and marshes where mobility was exceedingly slow, rendered the police utterly ineffective. The usual emolument received by a daroga hardly exceeded rupees twenty with which he was expected to make both ends meet. Far from the control of the higher authorities and vested with the powers both of a prosecutor and judge, the daroga had become a byword of reproach of extortion and oppression.¹¹
CONSOLIDATION AND MATERIAL PROGRESS
The abolition of the khel system by throwing the entire burden on land resulted in substantial increase in the revenue of the government. This was partly due to the assessment in 1835-6 of bari (garden) lands, in lieu of hearth, poll and capilation taxes, hitherto, totally excmpted from taxation. In 1832-3, the net revenue stood at Rs. 183, 196, in 1833-4 increased to Rs. 227, 128 and in 1837-8 when reorganisation was completed it rose to Rs. 403,968.12 There was a further upward trend in revenue when land tax was introduced in the districts of Sibsagar and Lakhimpur. "The revenue of the province", Jenkins remarked in 1844, "will now cover all the expenses of management . . . and the province will no longer, under any circumstances that can be forcseen, be a burden on the finances of the old province."¹"
Notwithstanding the steady rise in revenue, attempts had been made by the district officers to enhance the rate of assessment. This was considered inexpedient by the Board of

Revenue in a newly conquered but partially-cultivated province like Assam. In their view "it would be more advantageous both as regards the government revenue and interest of the people to reduce the rate from the higher to lower standard than to adopt the reverse of the proposition". The wishes of the Board were respected more by the breach than observance. In 1852 on the modification of the tarh, the standard measure from 11% to 12' there occurred a risc in rates in all categories of land. Again in 1859, another attempt was made to raise the assessment on the plea of equalising the rate of all the districts with that of Kamrup which was then the highest. They were also motivated by their desire of compelling the ryots by the increased demand to work under the tea-planters who were then facing acute scarcity of labour in their operations. The Commissioner of Assam stood opposed to any enhancement in the rate of rupit or arable land as that would scare the ryots away from the cultivation of rice crop, the staple food; and in fact many had already diverted to the production of crops like mustard, the profitability of which had in the meantime gone up several times. In lieu of enhancement of rate in rupit land, towards the close of the same year, with the sanction of the Government of Bengal, Jenkins raised the rates of non rupit lands in all the districts except Kamrup. In Nowgong and Darrang it rose to rupee one and annas two from amas fourteen and in Sibsagar and Lakhimpur to a rupec from annas twelve and fourteen respectively.16
To increase the paying capacity of the ryots, of course, endeavours had been made, from time to time, to give them a commercial and industrial bias by encouraging cultivation of crops which were easily marketable and by creating a class of speculators, local and foreign, to exploit the natural resources of the province.

CONSOLIDATION AND MATERIAL PROGRESS
Government of Bengal the project of a mulberry farm of one thousand bighas and the distribution of five hundred reels to the local people who would be trained in improved methods of spinning and weaving by artisans imported from Bengal.¹ In the following year, he started the work at Desh Darrang (Mangaldai sub-division); but the premature death of the Commissioner in the same year and subsequent indifference of the Government of Bengal brought the experiment to a close.¹ In recommending the tax on bari lands Jenkins was prompted by his desire of converting these "wastes and haunts of wild beasts into fruitful fields of sugarcane, mustard, mulberry, lac, tobacco and vegetables." He thought that "when the people will find that they will have to pay for them (bari lands) they will consider to what advantage they can turn them". 19
17
The local authorities were alive from the very beginning of the fact that unless the vast tracts of waste lands which covered the greater part of the province were brought under tillage neither the resources of the government nor of the people could be improved. They were however allergic to the allotment of these lands to the local people. In their view "the most wandering and least industrious of the people" generally apply for these grants; and with their "indolent contentiment" no improvement could be effected in the province. Considering introduction of foreign "enterprise, capital and skill" as absolutely necessary the Government of Bengal on the recommendation of the Board of Revenue laid down that no grant should be made of less than five hundred acres in extent and unless the grantee satisfied the Collector that he possessed the required capital and implements for its utilization.2¹ Under these rules one-fourth of the grant was

to be exempted from taxation, but the remaining three-fourth of it was to be granted rent-free for a period of twenty years after which it was to be assessed at a graduated rate from an anna and half to six annas per acre.² The local entrepreneurs were debarred from applying for these grants under favourable terms; very few of them possessed the necessary wealth qualification. Though belatedly, in April 1856, the Commissioner drew the attention of the Board that although on account of their limited means and "ineptitude for the management of local estates" the people of Assam had not been able to do much in the improvement of waste lands, yet many of them cvinced a desire "to create for themselves farms" in the hope of maintaining their families by this means. The response from the European speculators was also not encouraging in spite of the liberal terms granted in their favour. The Government of Bengal, therefore, approved in May 1856, the grant of waste lands in future to Europeans, Assamese and Bengalees and others without distinction and for the cultivation of whatever crop the grantee might think proper.23
53
The liberal terins for the grant of waste lands and the successful experiment then carried on by the government in the culture and manufacture of tea in Upper Assam encouraged the newly-constituted Assam Tea Company in London to enter into the field.* Major Jenkins, ever eager as he was to encourage foreign entrepreneurs, strongly urged the making over the government establishments to the Company since the Government of India had already announced that "in the event of the trial proving successful, the cultivation and manufacture should be left entirely to individual enterprise".

ously and respectfully constituted" all the benefits resulting from the employment of public money inasmuch as that would tantamount to the grant of monopoly of indefinite duration.25 Fearing that "any postponment in the matter might depress and discourage the spirit of enterprise then alive", Lord Auckland authorised the local authorities to allow the Assam Company or any other concern to commence operation subject to the rules and conditions to be laid down hereafter by the government.26
Towards the close of 1839, the Assam Company occupied a part of Gabharu hills in the district of Sibsagar and under Mr. Masters set up an establishment of their own at Nazira on the bank of the river Dikhow. In the following year, not only the Company was allowed to collect and purchase tea-leaves in Muttock, but two-third of government plantation including services of C. A. Brucc, the Superintendent of the gardens, were transferred to their control. The operations of the Company soon extended to several tea tracts in Muttock and territory of the Singphos-Kahong, Tipam, Nowholea, Jogundo and Ningroo; and as early as 1843 the Company was happy to announce its maiden dividend of three per cent to its share holders. For the next two years, however, the Company had to face acute economic crisis leading to the closure of some factories and resignation for mismanagement of both Masters and Bruce. The measures of stringent economy subsequently adopted by the Company under able management of Messrs Burkinyong, Campbell, Mornay and Williamson enabled it to convert the deficit into a surplus. The divident of two and half per cent which was renewed in 1852 steadily rose to nine per cent in 1858. The subsequent years saw the formation of Maijan Tea Company and the Jorhat Tea Company besides opening

of gardens at Mothola, Bojalani, Sukdongia, Bokapara, Barbarua, Nagaghuli and Deosal. The Assam Company in the meantime extended its operations to Cachar and the northern bank of the Brahmaputra. During 1858-9, of about eight thousand acres under cultivation, the Assam Company alone held more than half, producing a yield of nearly seven lakh pounds of tea in eighteen factories.20

In carrying out their operations the planters had to face immense difficulties, particularly of labour, both skilled and unskilled. The Chinese tca-makers had to be imported in initial stages from their settlements in Singapur, Batavia and Penang. A Chinese tea-maker could not be had at less than rupees forty whereas his Assamese counterpart (tekela) could be engaged at less than rupecs ten. Apart from being costly the Chinese at times proved themselves "intractable and worthless".30 The unfriendly relations that then existed with the Government of China ultimately forced the planters to resort to local artisans, and fortunately for them, the latter proved before long as efficient as the Chinese. In their reportof 1842, the Directors of the Assam Company prophesied :

hands at seasons when these were greatly needed. There would be no solution of the problem, Jenkins thought, unless steps were taken to procure labour from areas of surplus population. This would not only provide labour to the planters but enable the local authorities to employ them during off season in the repair and reconstruction of roads and works of public utility. Recruitment of the Dhengas from the South-West Provinces had hardly begun, when the rumour spread that of those who had gone to Assam none had returned, all died. The problem became all the more difficult on account of the lack of proper transport and the long distance to be covered to the tea districts of Assam.33 operation with the local authorities of the area and also of the Indigo-planters in Bihar, the recruiting agents allayed the fears and suspicions of the Dhengas and succeeded in alluring them in batches to make their way into Assam.³ The problem of transport continued to exist until 1861 when the Indian General Steam Navigation Company introduced their regular service for the carriage of labour and stores along the Brahmaputra.

32
The indigenous people were loath to work hard mainly because they had limited wants; they were satisfied "with the humblest of food, plainest of clothes and smallest of habitations". The requirements of their daily life were produced by their own toil; they "cultivate rice, pulses, fruits (and) vegetables to supply their tables; mustard to light their houses (and) silk (or) cotton to provide their garments".35 Whatever little trade existed it was through door to door barter of commodities like clothes, cotton and muga yarn, rice, pulses, turineric, mustard oil, tobacco and opium. Attempts had been made since the days of Scott to create a taste among the Assamese for commodities not locally available and gradually

hats and markets were springing up in and around the sadar stations. There arrived before long traders from Dacca and Calcutta with loads of foreign textiles, foodstuff and luxuries. Through hawkers they collected articles of local produce in exchange of foreign salt, opium, broad cloth and ironwares. Woollen goods, sugar, cocoanut oil and fine rice soon found their way into local markets.
External trade was confined formerly to the barter of agricultural and animal produce in exchange of Bengal salt. In 1808-9, of the total import of Rs. 228,300, Hamilton refers, an amount of Rs. 192,500 was expended on account of salt and the rest on articles of luxuries of the rich and few European residents in the country. The trade with Bengal which was mainly river-borne was subjected to customs duties at Kandahar or Hadira chokey, opposite to Goalpara, on the Brahmaputra. The duty levied at Hadira was ordinarily 10% ad valorem, but on certain commodities the duties were imposed so arbitrarily as to discourage merchants to have commercial transactions with Assam. Transit duties were also levied at several places beyond Kandahar, at Garo hats, Naga khats and river ghats of Cachar.³7 The divergent views held by the local authorities on the customs chokeys and the indifference of the Government of Bengal left the merchants entirely at the mercy of the customs officials. The delays, forfeitures and occasional oppressions in all the stages of journey of goods from producers to the consumers led the Governor-General in Council in March 1835 to abolish Kandahar and other chokeys in its neighbourhood and to leave the trade to and from Bengal perfectly free.³8
The abolition of the customs chokeys and the growing security of life and property gave a fillip to the trade with Bengal. Lac, oil seeds, cotton and silk, both raw and manufactured, formed the most important commodities of export.

CONSOLIDATION AND MATERIAL PROGRESS
The increasing import of foreign textiles and consequent decline of the cotton industry in Bengal, affected the cotton trade in Assam. However jute, pulses, teel, wax, rhinoceros' horn were imported by the merchants of Bengal. Of the imports apart from salt, foreign cloth, foodstuff and commodities used by men of average means were on the increase.* Since the abolition of the Kandahar chokey it is difficult to arrive at a correct estimate of the trade with Bengal; but that the volume and variety had considerably increased is borne out by the fact that the trade of Goalpara alone, as estimated by district officers, was approximately twenty-two lakhs." Although the balance of trade was not unfavourable in some districts, it is difficult to hold a similar view with respect to the province as a whole.
39
In spite of the endeavours that had been made by the local authorities the material progress of the province continued to be slow. Dhekial Phukan in his Observation on the Administration of the Province of Assam deplores that the British government had failed "to improve in any material degree the condition and prosperity of the country or even to repair the loss, it had lately sustained from the domestic wars and foreign invasions".40 Despite liberal terms that werd offered, vast tracts continued to be wastes throughout the province. The hopes entertained by Jenkins that the upper classes who had hitherto depended upon government service for their livelihood would take the lead in agriculture and industrial undertakings doomed to bitter disappointment. They had neither the means nor even inclination to form a class of landed proprietors like the zamindars of Bengal. The agricultural ryots, on the otherhand, remained satisfied with his pittance of arable land wherein he raised the salidhan, his staple food. His mode of cultivation continued to be primitive and the implements, he used, were of the archaic type. The annual produce was for his immediate need; scarcely was

there a surplus for sale or for a rainy day. Therefore, in the event of the failure of crops on account of draught or inundations conditions bordering famine were of frequent occurrence.¹¹ A number of indigenous industries, particularly spinning and weaving of cotton and silk, continued to exist and met domestic requirements, but their qualities being comparatively poor, they could hardly compete with cheaper and better varieties imported from abroad. Likewise increasing import of brass-copper-ironwares hit the local artisans hard while the gold-washers (sonowals) took to agriculture when they found their time-honoured pursuits less economic. In trade the whole traffic was carried on by the outsiders, particularly by the Keyas or the merchants from Marwar. "The Assamese", in the words of a contemporary, "see a set of strangers in the land getting rich before their own eyes, none ever follows their example and they appear to have no inclination to enter into competition with these foreigners". 12
41
The economic changes, however, resulted in a steady increase in population. In the absence of reliable data, it is not possible to give an accurate estimate as to the number of inhabitants in Assam prior to British occupation. That the number of deaths and desertions during the period of civil wars and invasions was enormous, is evident from the fact that in 1826 the population of the valley of the Brahmaputra, according to official sources, was estimated at 830,000 souls.¹¹ The administrative confusion, oppression and extortion in the carly days of the Company's rule reduced the number, according to Pemberton, to less than seven lakhs. In 1853, according to the figures supplied by the district officers to Mills, the population of Assam proper including Goalpara exceeded twelve lakhs and this rose to about fifteen lakhs in 1872.45 This increase in population was due to the influx of

16 It was calculated that out of 775, 844 foreigners in the province, Hill districts inclusive, 645,000 were tea-garden labourers; majority of them, instead of returning to their original home after expiry of their agreements, settled as cultivators in the province.

Anti-British Movements : Later Phase
The ever increasing inflow of immigrants into Assam produced consequences of far reaching importance in the political, economic and cultural life of the Assamese. No foreigner (Bangal as he was called) was permitted by the Ahom government to settle in Assam unless he contributed to the cultural and material prosperity of the people. Muslim immigrants were allowed to settle in Assam since their services were essential "in deciphering and interpreting of Persian documents, carving of inscriptions . . . minting of coins, embroidery works, painting with fast colours, carpentry, sword and gun making and the manufacture of gun powder".¹ There is hardly any evidence of coinmunal outburst or ill-feeling between the Muslims and Hindus of Assam. Nowhere had the immigrant Muslims identified themselves so completely with the indigenous people as in the valley of the Brahmaputra. Shihabuddin Talish found amongst the Assamese Muslims "nothing of Islain except the name; their hearts are inclined far more towards mixing with the Assamese than towards association with the Muslims".2 To facilitate commercial transactions with Bengal, merchants of Marwar were allowed to set up golas or depots at several locations in western Assam.

petty agents stroll about the frontiers, wherever there is a chance for making a rupee".³ The very fact that a handful of foreigners penetrated and carried on their transactions into the interior of the country without any let or hindrance clearly shows that their relations with the local people were quite friendly although they remained socially aloof. Likewise, the tea-garden labourers, Hindustanee sepoys, the Nepalese, etc. continued to constitute a floating population following their respective customs, usages and traditions.
The case was otherwise with the settlers from the neighbouring districts of Bengal. Since north-east Bengal hitherto formed a part of the ancient kingdom of Kamarupa, later Kamata, there had been frequent contacts between the inhabitants of these regions which was evident from their linguistic and cultural affinities.* The process was accelerated when the Ahom King Siva Singha (1714-44) made Hinduism the state religion and initiated himself into it by a saktist priest of Nawadwip whom the neophyte king made the chief of the Kamakhya temple, the centre of the tantric cult in Eastern India. Though the commercial treaty which Gaurinath Singha (1780-94) had entered into with Captain Welsh in 1793 opened the gates to the merchants of Bengal to enter into the interior of the province, it was not until British occupation of Assam when avenues of employment both in office and trade were opened that the inflow of population from the districts of Sylhet, Dacca, Mymensingh and Rangpur actually began. The amlahs of Bengal replaced the official aristrocracy when the latter proved themselves incapable of discharging their duties under the alicn government.* The task of the new recruits was made all the more easier when in April 1831 Government of Bengal made Bengali in place of Persian the language of the court; for it was found too costly and too difficult to have substitute when a Persian scribe was on leave

or left the service. Before long, the newcomers from Bengal not only made the revenue and judicial departments their sole preserve, but their services became equally indispensable to the newly-started government schools for dearth of local teachers specially to impart instructions in Bengali which had since been made the medium of instruction.

It was not so much the cultural or linguistic domination as the economic impact-their virtual monopoly of office in all departments-that made the immigrants from Bengal the eye-sore of the upper classes for whom there was now no means of livelihood except that of government service. Their feelings were to a great extent shared by their sympathisers and supporters, and this was accentuated during the period of administrative confusion when it was generally held that the amlahs were at the root of all the cvils. They had high hopes that their fortunes would be retrieved on the restoration of the old regime. The anti-British movements which they organised succeeded in raising Purandar to the throne of Upper Assam; but the latter belied their expectations. In utter disappointment and disgust they worked for the ruin of the exraja and therein too, they succeeded. Their condition however became all the more worse; in the settlement of 181011, Captain Brodie, the newly appointed Principal Assistant, Sibsagar, abolished the khels and divided the whole district into innumerable fiscal units (tangonees) placing over cach a man of respectability and character irrespective of rank, whether a Phukan, Baruah, Saikia or Borah. The levelling tendency of the British government however enlightened it might have been, was premature in a country where distinction on account of one's birth or rank was too deeply ingrained to be obliterated so hurriedly. The men of rank found it

beneath their dignity to work hand in hand with those who had been till recently their subordinates. They were further irritated when they found that the khats which they held rent-free were also brought under assessment. The condition of the upper classes became all the more deplorable on the abolition of slavery by Act V in 1843 when they were pushed down to the level of ordinary ryots. "Those whose ancestors never lived by digging, ploughing or carrying burdens are now reduced to such degrading employments". To their mortification they found their privileges and immunities were lost to them while to meet the rising demands of the government or even to eke out a miserable existence, many had to mortgage or sell whatever tangible property they possessed.

.
No wonder, therefore, the upper orders could hardly reconcile themselves to the British government. As the years rolled on, their lot became more and more deplorable. Their salvation lay, they felt, only in the restoration of the ancient regime by overthrowing the alien government. Who would organise and lead them in the war of liberation? Initially their hopes rested on the members of the royal family; but Purandar had died in 1846 and Kameswar, his son and successor, passed away a few years after. There remained Kandarpeswar, the Charing Raja*, then a mere boy of eleven. From an unexpected quarter, however, there had arrived the man of destiny, Maniram Baruah, hitherto, one of the most loyal and trusted officer of the East-India Company.
As early as 1828, the ability, intelligence and resourcefulness of Maniram had attracted the attention of Captain Neufville, the Political Agent, Upper Assam, who made him the Sheristudar-Tahsildar of the division.12 Maniram revealed his administrative genius in the reorganisation of the khels under which the deficit of revenue of the earlier years was converted into a surplus. Not only did he not show any sympathy in the abortive movements against the British, but aided the local authoritics with provisions and labour in their expeditions against the insurgent Khasis, the Garos and the Bhutias.1. The services of Maniram continued to be indispensable under the restored monarch Purandar who entrusted to him in addition to his earlier duties, the supervision of several fiscal units (bishayas). The resumption of Upper Assam brought ruin not only to the Raja but also to Maniram; for under Brodie's

revenue measures the latter was deprived of all the fiscal charges with the exception of three mouzas. After serving a few years as the Dewan or the chief executive of the Assam Company at Nazira, Maniram attempted to open a few gardens of his own at Jorhat; but he failed on the refusal of the authoritics to grant him waste lands at concessional rates like the European planters. To aggravate the situation, in 1851 Brodie's successor Charles Holroyd transferred from him even the remaining mouzas which his family held for a generation to an individual who was hitherto subordinate to him. Without rank, without honour and even without the very means of livelihood, Maniram found it extremely difficult to run a houschold of 185 souls.¹1
Maniram felt, like disaffected nobles, that there was no future for him and his countrymen without the restoration of the former government. It was doubtful if the Dewan at this stage ever thought of waging a war against the Company. In any case he threw his lot with Kandarpeswar Singha who was also then experiencing utmost difficulties in shouldering the responsibilities of a family that was on the verge of ruin. Though young, Kandarpeswar realised that the authorities in Calcutta would not reopen the question of restoration in his favour when they had turned down the representations which were repeatedly made by his predecessors. Nor could he pray for a pension or pecuniary assistance, for that would close the door once for all for further representation. Kandarpeswar accepted the guardianship of the Dewan who never ceased, as alleged, harping on him with "sanguinary hopes of getting the country to his management". 15
Soon an unlooked for opportunity presented itself. To institute an enquiry into the administrative affairs, in June 1853, A. J. Moffat Mills, the Judge Sadar Dewani Adawlat, paid a visit to Assam. When Mills arrived at Sibsagar,

<content>Memorials to Mills by Maniram
Kandarpeswar waited upon him and urged in a representation to him his right to hold Upper Assam on a tributary basis under the East-India Company.¹6 Though he was given a patient hearing, the young prince was discouraged by Mills from entertaining any hope of restoration.¹7 Maniram also submitted two memorials to Mills; in one he prayed for some favours from the government in recognition of the continuous loyal services rendered by him ; in the other, the more significant one, he pleaded for the restoration of the monarchy in favour of Ghana Kanta Singha, the son of ex-raja Chandrakanta Singha.18 Maniram presented a balance sheet of the administration of the East India Company for over a quarter of century emphasing therein the grievances of the people, the higher classes in particular.
By the stoppage of such cruel practices as extracting the eyes, cutting off noses and cars, and the forcible abduction of virgins from their homes and by the removal of all wayside transit duties, ... the British government has (earned) for itself inestimable praise and renown, but by the introduction into the province of new customs, numerous courts, an unjust system of taxation, an objectionable treatment of the hill tribes, neither the British government nor their subjects have gained any benefit. 19

Amongst other evils, Maniram referred to the introduction of government opium, the destruction of indigenous artisans, the neglect of the study of the sastras, the appointment of inhabitants of Marwar and the Bengalees of Sylhet as mouzadars, the scrapping of the prescriptive rights and immunitics of the higher orders reducing them down to the level of ordinary ryots and the discontinuance of the pujas at the temple of Kamakhya subjecting the country, thereby, to famines, pestilence and other calamities. "Illustrious Sir" deplored Maniram :
"We are just now as it were in the belly of a tiger; and if our misfortunes yielded any advantage to the Government, We

should be content; but the fact is, there is neither gain to the people nor the Government; and so long as the present state of things continues, we see no prospect of improvement in future."20
Much of the maladies Maniram attributed to the appointment of a number of inexperienced young military officers in charge of the districts. "Their youth, and indiscretion prevented their discriminating between good and evil or regard with any consideration, the manners and customs of the people."2¹ He therefore strongly urged the restoration of an Ahom prince that might reintroduce, with modification, the customs and institutions of the good old days. The prince so raised would be aided by a civil officer designated as Mahamantri who would also be in charge of a local militia that might be detailed for military defence of the territory. After meeting all the charges of the establishment, the Dewan calculated, there would be a surplus in revenue to the extent of two lakhs.22
In his report Mills, too, made adverse comments on various aspects of the administration sparing none, high or low; but he considered the evils referred to by Maniram in his representation as highly exaggerated. To him Maniram was an "untrustworthy and intriguing person" whose real motive was "to get the country restored to Rajah Poorandar Singha's descendant".23 The object of the Sadar Judge was not the withdrawal but consolidation of the British rule in Assam. The people in general, too, Mills believed, then living in comparative ease and security, had not the least desire to be placed under their former Rajas. IIe therefore suggested. to the government of India to inform the young prince once for all not to entertain any hope of restoration in future.24
Disappointed in his attempt to convince Mills of the justice and propriety of his case, Maniram determined to plead

personally before the authorities in Calcutta on behalf of prince Kandarpeswar Singha. 25 He arrived there in carly 1857 and made through his friends several futile attempts to represent the case before the Lieutenant Governor of Bengal. About this time there occurred the upsurge of the sepoys at Merrut, Lucknow and Kanpur; and Bahadur Shah, the last of the Moghuls, was proclaimed by the rebels the Emperor of Hindustan in Delhi. He could also take the lead, thought Maniram, in organising a similar uprising against the British with the ultimate object of restoring Ahom rule in Assam. What he could not achieve by prayers and entreatics, Maniram resolved to accomplish by sword and sword alone. Through his letters, couched in the most seditious terms Maniram goaded Kandarpeswar Singha to unfurl the standard of revolt with the aid of the local sepoys and through his friend Madhu Mallick, a Bengalee muktear,* he prepared the ground for the insurrection. Captain Holroyd, the Principal Assistant, Sibsagar, reported 25 :
The young Rajah was advised by Muddoo Mullick. who had been sent up by Muniram from Calcutta, to assemble certain of Booroalis and Phookans around Joorhat and acquaint them the contents of Munniram's letter. This was done accordingly, and at this consultation it was determined to send Mohesh Chandra alias Pecalie, one of their members to Seebsagar to ascertain the feelings of Dootiram Fouzdarie Sheristadar, the Pance Phookan and others.
In accordance with the foregoing resolution, Mohesh Chandra ulius Pealic proceeded to Seebsagar with a letter from the Saring Rajah to Dootiram Sherishtadar and having tarried there about a week had interviews with the Sherishtadar and then returned to Joorhat bearing a letter to the Saring Rajah from the said Sheristadar together with a message of encouragement, stating that he (the Sheristadar) would shortly send his eldest son Preolall (Sub-Inspector of Schools) to Joorhat to communicate with him (the Saring Rajah) in person.
Preolall arrived at Joorhat in the month of Assar (June-July)

ings and desires, and urged him to act up to Munniram's advice He also received gold from the Rajah for the furtherance it would appear of his (the Rajah's) designs.
The task before Maniram was not an easy one. Until August 1857 the sepoys of the Assam Light Infantry Battalions, both at Dibrugarh and Gauhati, remained absolutely passive and strictly loyal.27 The heterogenous nature of the regiments consisting as these did of the Nepalese, the Manipuris, the Rabhas, the Jorrowas, and the Doancahs combined with the settled and peaceful life enjoyed by them made even the upcountry sepoys rather indifferent to the occurrences of Northern India. The situation, however, altered with the defection of Kunwar Singh of Jagadishpur and the Mutiny of the Danapur regiments in Bihar when there occurred a spirit of restlessness among the sepoys of the Assam Light Infantry. As the news trickled through visitors, fakirs, newspapers and private letters of the murder of the Englishmen and women in Northern India, the sepoys were led to believe that their kinsmen had occupied the greater part of Hindustan, that the English would soon quit Bengal and Assam too." They were spurred into activity when there arrived at the military lines of the detachment at Golaghat in the district of Sibsagar two confidential agents supposed to have been sent by Kandarpeswar Singha with tempting baits: "The Raja would double the pay of the sepoys and give the native officer's pay like Jongie Paltan, if all the sepoys would join and get him the country".29 Negotiations under similar terms were carried on with the sardars of the sepoys at Sibsagar, Dibrugarh and Saikhowa. Holroyd reported:
'At the end of the month of Assar or beginning of Sawan Pealie was deputed to Golaghat with letters from the Saring Rajah finally to arrange matters with the Native Officers and sepoys on that command. When there, he visited other people also ot

In the month of Assar, Noor Mahoned Jamdr., of the 1st Assam Lt. Infy. came down from Deebrooghur to Joorhat on private leave and had interviews with the Rajah regarding the assistance to be afforded by the sepoys, and of the remuneration they were to receive for placing him on the Guddee.

During this month, of Assar and Sawan the Saring Rajah hela frequent meetings at Joorhat at which Pealie, Muddoo Mullick, the Hensou Booroa and the Kumla Saringia Booroa took each an active part; among others who attended was the Mahommedan Bahadoor Gaon Boora and Furmood, who exerted themselves to induce others of their persuasion in the place to unite in the aid of the Raja's designs.31

Temples (and) Shastes (Satras) to which Ghee and oil was (sic) to be distributed for a similar purpose having a similar object in view to accomplish which, money was paid by order of the Saring Rajah.32
The Commissioner of Assam was roused from his torpor when in the middle of August 1857 he received from Holroyd the intelligence that several officers of the Assam Light Infantry with the detachment at Golaghat had entered into a conspiracy with the young prince Kandarpeswar offering him the assistance of the regiment "to reinstate him on his throne and maintain the country for him".33 To protect the lives and properties of the Europeans there was not a single European soldier at this juncture in the whole of the NorthEast Frontier. A sudden and concerted move on the part of both the regiments at Gauhati and Dibrugarh would have rendered the position of the few European officers and planters in Assam extremely precarious. Major Jenkins lost no time in drawing attention of the Government of India to the seriousness of the situation and urging it to despatch as hurriedly as possible, a European force "to save the province from the revolution. The Governor-General in Council was greatly alarmed, but the paucity of troops on the simultaneous outbreak of sepoys in scattered areas rendered it difficult to send reinforcement into Assam. To tide over the immediate crisis a small European force of 104 sea-men, half of them raw recruits, was despatched under Lieutenant Davis on board the Haroonghatta on 11 September 1857.35 In the meanwhile Major Hannay called back from the outlying detachments the Rabhas, the Manipuris, the Nepalese and other non-Hindustanees whom he could rely to guard the military lines at the headquarters.36 In Nowgong, Mr Morton, the Principal Assistant, destroyed the bridges over the rivers Misa and Diju and

cut off communications with Jorhat lest the mutineers might enter into the district from that direction.37
The precautionary measures filled the mutineers with the notion that the English were terribly afraid of their activities and that they would quit at the earliest available opportunity. It was in the air that a steamer was on the way and that the Sahibs were preparing to depart.38 To finalise the plan of operations, on 29 August at about 9 P.M. at the quarters of Shaikh Bhikan, the subedar of the detachment at Golaghat, a meeting was held, the proceedings of which as narrated by Keramat Ali, the native doctor who was reported to be an eye-witness of the event, were as follows¹9:
73
On arriving, I saw a number of men collected in front of Subedar's house; in the midst the Subedar Shaikh Bheekun, Chunder Singh, the Jamadar of Police and Ramtohul Singh, the Kote Havildar, were scated in morahs; the rest being on the ground ..

Unfortunately the sepoys could not arrive at an unanimous decision. Some wanted to march out immediately, others desired to wait till the morning; while a few not only protested but left the meeting.40 Immediately on receipt of the proceedings of the mutineers, Major Hannay, the Commandant of the First Assam Light Infantry, effected the apprehension of the subedar and the ring-leaders and removed them to Dibrugarh.¹¹ On 9 September Holroyd with a detachment under Captain Lowther arrested Kandarpeswar Singha, who was immediately despatched to Calcutta and kept confined as a state prisoner at Alipur. This was followed by the arrest of Maniram in Calcutta and his collaborators, both officials and non-officials-Dutiram Baruah, Mayaram Nazir, Marangikhowa Gohain, Bahadur Gaoburah, Shaikh Farmud and several others.13

The Commissioner was happy to report on 9 October that "there is no further cause for any apprehension of any outbreak in Assam".44 He was greatly disillusioned. Towards the close of November 1857, the outbreak of the 34th Native Infantry at Chittagong and the 73rd Dacca Regiment altered the whole situation. It was feared that this might be synchronous with the descent of the predatory tribes; "the setting in of dry season greatly facilitates the movement of the sepoys, and is the time always selected by the savages in the hills for carrying out their warlike expeditions". The European settlers in Upper Assam, the tea-planters in particular, felt that their lives and properties continued to be insecure. D. C. Mackey, the Chairman of the Assam Company, represented; "we are entering upon a more dangerous period on that frontier than has been since the commencement of the outbreak, and it seems evident that the small

force of half-trained seamen already sent up are inadequate to secure the safety of the province".45 To save the province from the threat of imminent danger, the Chairman urged on the Government of India to despatch a European force "in the most expeditious way possible". Fortunately, the Dacca mutineers on their northward march after crossing the Brahmaputra destroyed the thana of Karaibari and carried off the jamadar and the burkandazes attached to it; but they made no attempt to effect a combination with the Chittagong sepoys who entered into the district of Sylhet with the object of joining in Cachar Narendrajit, the pretender to the Manipur throne, and his followers. After their initial successes at a place known as Latu, the mutineers were closely followed and repeatedly attacked by the Sylhet Light Infantry under Lieutenant Ross until they were reduced to a few who escaped death or apprehension.40 The Government of India was relieved of the necessity of sending additional troops to the frontier.

At Dibrugarh, the mutinous sepoys were put before a Court Martial; and almost all of them were transported for life; some had to suffer long term imprisonment, and the sepoys of the detachment at Golaghat were discharged from duty.¹7 Through the aid of Haranath Baruah, the Sadar daroga, Holroyd succeeded in procuring a mass of evidence against Maniram and his collaborators. Vested with the powers of a Commissioner under Act XIV of 1857, the Principal Assistant commenced trial of the rebels including Maniram who had then been brought from Calcutta.

Baruah, Marangikhowa Gohain, Trinayan, Mayaram Nazir, on charges of complicity of the plot or aiding and abetting it, received transportation of life. Bahadur gaoburah and Farmud Ali "on charge of seducing the Mussalmans at Jorhat" had also to leave for the Andamans with confiscation of property.
The trial of Maniram and his associates has been subjected to severe criticisms. "Captain Holroyd and Haranath Parbatia Baruah, the daroga of Sibsagar, went to extremes in their vendetta against all probable sympathisers of the plot".50 Most of the rebels were tried rather hurriedly on evidences, some of which were collected in all probability by pressure or persuasion. Captain Holroyd who was not on good terms with Maniram had acted as "both Prosecutor and Judge", and neither Maniram nor any other prisoner was ever given the chance of self-defence. When these high handed and irregular proceedings reached the Government of Bengal, the special Commission given to Holroyd was withdrawn in August 1858. In consideration of his age, inexperience and the fact that he was not "a voluntary agent" Kandarpeswar was not brought to trial; he was kept as an internec at Burdwan until December 1860; after which he was allowed to settle as a pensioner at Gauhati where he died in 1880.52
Thus ended the endeavours made by Maniram to overthrow the British Government in Assam. This was partly due to his inability to organise a united front of the nobility against the common enemy namely the English. Not the daroga Haranath alone, but a substantial section of the men of rank who continued to be indifferent aided the local authorities in bringing the rebels to book out of fear or from hopes of personal gain to be obtained in the hands of the British.

Maniram also had failed to realise that his was a lost causethat the masses in general were losing faith in a monarchy that had discredited itself by its oppression, misrule and betrayal at the hour of the worst peril; that in spite of their faults and failures the British had provided the common-man all that he wanted-the security of life and property.

In the meantime extension of British revenue and police jurisdiction and the operation of the European speculators beyond the border areas could not but produce ill-feeling and resentment among the tribesmen to whom "no motive was strong as the preservation of their rights on lands and forests whether old or newly acquired". The Khamti chiefs were allowed after the removal of the Sadiya Khowa the management of their respective affairs; but the Assamese inhabitants, both in Sadiya and Saikhowa, were brought under direct control of Lieutenant Charlton, the newly-appointed officer incharge, Sadiya.53 The latter was not only to exercise magisterial duties with the aid of a panchayat but was authorised to levy capitation taxes varying from annas eight to a rupec.³ Even under the Ahom Rajas the Sadiya Khowa used to collect some revenue in cash or kind in and around Sadiya; but during the period of civil war and invasions the Khamtis overthrow the authority of the Ahom viceroy and reduced the position of the Assamese to slaves. When this act of usurpation after the lapse of half a century became an established right, the Khamtis considered the recent measures as a grievance, for these deprived them of the services of those on whom their very livelihood depended. Another irritant was, that in the interest of the European planters, the waste lands which were hitherto under the jurisdiction of the Khamti chiefs were declared now the property of the government. The very presence of the officer in charge of Sadiya and his active interference in their internal affairs inevitably produced in the minds of the Khamtis great dissatisfaction and resentment.

ANTI-BRITISH MOVEMENTS : LATER PHASE
The annexation of Upper Assam and the growing insecurity of the frontier demanded the removal of the headquarters of the Assam Light Infantry to Sadiya.55 This was construed by the Khamtis as preparations to bring them under effective control of the government or to drive them out of Assam. Hardly had Major White, the Commandant of the Assam Light Infantry, removed a part of the regiment to Sadiya when on 28 January 1839 the Khamtis, numbering about six hundred, armed with daos, spears and muskets attacked the cantonment, seized the magazine and set fire to the military lines killing everyone on the way-men, women and children. After a feeble resistance Major White also fell into the hands of the assassins.56
To subvert the British Government this was considered to be "the boldest attempt yet made in the eastern frontier".57 Apart from the Khamtis, it was generally believed, the Singphos, the Muttocks and even the Court of Ava had a secret hand in the insurrection. The seriousness of the situation had been cloquently expressed by W. W. Bird, a member of the Governor-General's Council:
There is little doubt that had the attack been successful, Upper Assam would have been in the utmost danger of being lost . . . The loss of the province or even any serious impression made upon our forces in that quarter would be attended with consequence, the extent of which it is not easy to lorsee. Not only would the whole of the tea-cultivation, now of more importance than ever be swept away, but it would open a road into the heart of our most valuable province to a host of enemies.58
The Khamtis were soon repulsed and Lieutenant Marshall who followed them up succeeded in killing Ranua Gohain, one of the rebel chiefs, and over a hundred on the spot. Captain Hannay, temporarily vested with the command of the regiment, raided the Khamti villages, burnt their granaries and

adopted vigorous measures to apprehend the ring leaders.59 To ensure security of the frontier, the cantonment was removed to Saikhowa on this side of the river and then to Sibsagar which commanded the route to Ava. To relieve the Assam Light Infantry from outpost duties a new levy the Second sebundy was raised with headquarters at Jaypur. Doubtful fidelity of the Singphos made it necessary to raise up stockades at Delli, Tazee, Koojoo and Ningroo, and also lines of communication from Saikhowa to Jaypur and thence to Ningroo so as to complete the line of defence.60

61
While these measures for security of the frontier were in progress, on 10 January 1843 the Singphos made a simultaneous attack at Beesa and Ningroo. The rebels were beaten off at the latter outpost, but the detachment at Beesa surrendered after two days when their ammunitions ran short; both the jamadar and the havildar, were tied up in a tree and hacked to pieces and most of the sepoys were sold out as slaves. The stockade at Koojoo was also besieged, but it was saved by the timely arrival of a party of sepoys under Lieutenant Lockett. All the Singpho chiefs, including the Beesa and Ningroola who had hitherto been loyal to the government, were involved in the outbreak; the acknowledged leader was however Serro-la-ten, the would be successor of the Beesa gaum. Feeling himself insecure, the Beesa surrendered and Ningroola followed suit. On being repulsed, several chiefs took up their position near Ningroo wherefrom they were dislodged by a party of sepoys under Licutenant Reid, the Commandant of the Local Artillery, Dibrugarh. Captain Vetch who had arrived in the meantime at Beesa to concert measures with Lieutenants Lockett and Reynold succeeded in driving the enemy from their stockaded position at

Beesa and Kerempani. Thereafter, the enemy could offer but little resistance, and most of them beat a hasty retreat abandoning their stocks and slaves.63
The sudden and simultaneous attack on the two frontier outposts followed by a report that Saikhowa was also threatened by a body of the Khamtis led Jenkins to believe that there was well organised plan of aggression in which the Tipam Raja,* then Governor of Maugaung, might also have a secret hand. In fact, since 1837, this scion of the Ahom Royal family had been claiming Upper Assam on the strength of his right as an heir-apparent to king Jogeswar Singha (1821). Through his agents, the pretender made it known to his relatives in Upper Assam that he was determined to recover his territory by force if it was not voluntarily made over to him by the British. So general was the feeling of an invasion of Assam by the Tipam Raja that many people for fear of a change in government attempted to placate his kith and kin by offer of presents or otherwise. This finds corroboration in a letter which Serro-la-ten and other gaums addressed to the local authorities. 65:
61
This land is ours and Vetch Sahib has taken it from us. Formerly Scott Sahib and Neufville Sahib gave to the Tengi Meyo (as the Singphos were called) from Dehingmookh, from Namsanginookh from Tipam Hill and in consequence of Vetch Sahib having taken it away we have made war and on that account we have fought also. Vetch Sahib has seized and carried off our Singphos. Further we have received orders from the Tipam Rajah to make war
Evidently apart from the order of the Tipam Raja, the gaums traced the origin of the outbreak to two

*The Tipam Raja alias Bishwanath Singha accompanied his sister Hemo Aidco whom the ex-raja Chandra Kanta (1810-8) offered as a present to the king of Ava, and the latter, as reported by Vetch, made the Tipam Raja the governor of a part of the province of Maugaung.

primary causes-the resumption of Singpho land and the seizure and confinement of the Singphos. In his letter to the Commissioner, the Beesa also wrote:
with respect to lands, these from Namnsangmookh, NoaDehing Mookh and to the Patkai, Galling Hills (?) are the Singpho lands; but you of the Company have forgotten what was said (sic) to Scott Sahih, and Neufville Sahib, and after this the Major (White) Sahib said, that the land is ours.

Captain Vetch could not dismiss the claims made by the chiefs as entirely baseless, but Jenkins categorically denied the charges levelled by Serrola and others that the Singphos had been deprived of their lands, particularly of the Becsa whom neither the British nor the former government ever acknowledged entitled to any land. What Becsa wanted, the Commissioner felt, was not an estate but an independent territory which he intended to be a part of the scheme of the Tipam Raja. To him the principal cause of the general discontent must be traced to the desertion of the slaves; without it other causes would not have driven the Singphos to revolt.67
In regard to the complicity of the Tipam Raja, Jenkins held the view that the Raja “connived at and encouraged", the Singphos to keep the frontier disturbed with a view to taking advantage of any extension of the rebellion to Assam and in the meantime to ascertaining the reaction of the higher classes to his claim to the throne. In spite of the protest which the Tipam Raja subsequently made in a letter to the Political Agent, the deposition made by several witnesses strengthened the belief that he had a secret hand in the outbreak. This is borne out by the fact that he had conferred on Serro-la-ten marks of distinction-a horse, a golden umbrella and five

seers of silver-when he crossed the frontier with the body of troops; and that he sent to the Beesa gaum three seers of needle, half of these broken, which the chief distributed amongst his followers and this, according to the custom of the Singphos, was the signal for war.68 Jenkins was right in his assertion that the desertion of slaves was one of the important, though not the sole, cause of the insurrection. To the Singphos the slaves constituted their most valuable property; on these they depended primarily for their agricultural labour. While the chance of raiding Assamese villages and carrying off their inhabitants became increasingly difficult, the extension of teagardens and the establishment of frontier guards encouraged slaves in larger number to leave their masters. The location of military posts in and around their villages though carried out with the concurrence of the chiefs produced irritation and discontentment; for they found themselves reduced and subjected in a great measure to the government of a jamadar or havildar. Above all, the subjugation of the Singphos to the court of the Principal Assistant could not but be offensive to the simple-minded hillmen whose notion of crime and justice was different from that of those who tried them. No wonder, therefore, the gaums saw in the extension of British power their common ruin, and therefore they determined to call a halt to it before it was too late.
On the alleged guilt of Rajendra Singh, it may be remembered, in 1835 the territory of Jayantia was incorporated into the British dominion. It was not so much the annexation as the conduct of the local authorities that strained the relations of the Syntengs, as the Jayantias were called, with the British government. Not only did the Political Agent assume charge of the territory, but he scized personal effects of the chief not sparing even his cooking pots.9 From his asylum at Sylhet, in vain the Raja poured in representations for a reconsideration of his case and restoration of his territory.

this, on the outbreak of the Sepoys in 1857, the ex-raja volunteered his services with a contingent of 2500, but this was summarily turned down and the chief was kept under restraint lest he might carry on intrigues with the anti-British elements in the hills.70
Allegations of "lawless proceedings" and "corrupt practices" of the dolois were made who were entrusted with the administration of civil and criminal justice within their respective elakas subject to the authority of the Political Agent."¹ To enquire into the anomalies, in 1854 A. J. M. Mills, tha Sadar Judge, visited the district; and on his recommendations a military guard was posted at Jowai. The Syntengs were, hitherto totally exempted from taxation. "We have acted unwisely and incquitably", thought Mills, "when in the neighbouring hills house-tax was paid". Sharing in this view, in 1858 W. J. Allen in his Report on the Administration of the Cosseyah and Jynteah Hill Territory also recommended a moderate house-tax.72 To make the authority of the paramount power "a real one" in 1860 a house-tax was introduced. The Syntengs stoutly opposed the innovation, expelled the tax collector and even resorted to armed resistance. The timely arrival of a regiment from Cherra brought the situation under control, but the attitude of the Syntengs continued to be hostile. To strengthen the security measures, the civil authorities were empowered to dismiss the dolois and sardars in cases of acts of insubordination, and the police officers were authorised to take cognisance of complaints brought against the heads of villages. When in the following year Income-tax was introduced, as clsewhere, the hillmen believed that the English were determined to stay and flecce them. On 17 January 1862, the Syntengs numbtring about six hundred made a surprise attack on the military outpost of Jowai, burnt

down the christian settlement and thereafter stockaded their villages in the neighbourhood.73 E. A. Rowlatt, the Deputy Commissioner, with a body of troops marched against the insurgents, occupied several villages, destroyed the stockades and burnt the granaries, but the "leaders of the insurrection in the east remained as violent as ever".74
J. C. Haughton, the officiating Agent, who later made an enquiry into the causes of the outbreak, severely commented on the imposition of the Income-tax as "unwise and inexpedient" on a people who could furnish no accurate account of their income; "the tax practically became one on property not on income and it was exacted from many who should have been exempted in the spirit of the Section 130 of the Income-Tax Act".75 In the meantime "imposts of one sort or another were in fact appearing like mushrooms". In 1860, Judicial Stamps were introduced, followed by taxation on fisheries. In the same year the right to cut timber was sold out to the highest bidder preventing the villagers, thereby, of cutting timber, fuel, thatch, etc.-a privilege which they enjoyed so long. The situation was aggravated by the introduction of a number of ill-conceived and unpopular measures. Soon after the outbreak in 1860, the overzealous Deputy Commissioner confiscated the swords and shields of the inhabitants. which they frequently nccded for self defence as well as at their pujus or religious ceremonies. He wounded their sentiments all the more when the swords were broken up and their shields burnt in their presence."7 In fact, the immediate cause of the outbreak was the interference in a puja at Jalong in the neighbourhood of Jowai by the police daroga who on receipt of information that a large quantity of swords and spears had been collected on the occasion, went up and forced, as alleged, the votaries to speak out, an act not permissible on such

solemn occasions. "Their former grievances" in the words of a contemporary, "were as heaps of powder in all directions, and the daroga there applied the torch to them and set the whole country in a blaze".78
Rowlatt suspected that the ex-raja was instrumental in fomenting the rebellion. The fact that a section of the Syntengs represented that if they were to be taxed it should be through their own chief and the outbreak followed soon after the petition was turned down proved to some extent the complicity of the chief. But there is hardly any doubt that the dolois and sardars, who had hitherto exerted considerable influence in the state could hardly reconcile themselves to the rule of the English who had deprived them of the power and privileges which they enjoyed from early times. The crown (raj) lands which they held as rent-free, it was rumoured, would be brought under assessment." They found their position greatly lowered by the presence in their midst of a daroga with whom the aggrieved invariably lodged their complaint. Above all they were now placed entirely at the mercy of officials of the court without whose support they could not expect to hold office even though elected by the people. Without the expulsion of the English, they felt, there was no future for them. The dolois and sardars thus took the fnitiative in the movement with the ultimate object of driving the dykhai (foreigners) from the hills. Brisk preparations were made for the war of liberation by collecting men, erecting stockades, storing up grains and sending emissaries for aid even to Burma.80
Considering the situation rather grave the Government of India placed Brigadier-General Showers of the Eastern Comand in Civil and Military Administration of the hills.81 For his "injudicious proccedings", Rowlatt was suspended and

transferred.82 The outbreak had already extended over the whole of the district. Showers issued a proclamation granting amnesty to all those who laid down arms with the exception of the ring leaders and those guilty of gross acts of aggression. A reward of rupees one thousand was offered for the apprehension of Ookiang Nongbah, the "principal instigator", of the outbreak. Columns of troops were sent out to different areas where the rebels were supposed to have removed their families and stores.8. 83 The prompt and vigorous measures resulted in the surrender of several chiefs; and inhabitants of Shillong, Muntang, Jowai, Latoobor, Lakadong and Nongtaong had returned to their villages and resumed respective occupations. Showers was relieved to report on 22 May 1862 that active operation were at an end and open opposition of the rebels had ceased.84
The hard core of the rebels, however, remained unsubdued. They showed little inclination to come to terms; on the contrary they let no opportunty slip to ambuscade parties of troops and travellers when they could do so with impunity. Notwithstanding the endeavours that were made by the local authorities and through the friendly chiefs to induce the ring leaders to come to terms, the latter remained unbending as ever and in fact openly demanded complete independence.55 In a durbar held at the village Moobokhon attended by several hundred rebels, Ookiang Nongbah announced in unambiguous terms that there would be no compromise with the English unless they were exempted from taxation, their Raja was restored, troops and police were withdrawn from the hills, that they would fight as long as they could and in the event of their being unsuccessful they would quit the hills.86

The prospect of a settlement being extremely remote, General Showers under direction of the Government of Bengal renewed the operations. The 29th Native Infantry then at Gauhati was ordered to advance into the hills and the detachments of the 44th Native Infantry in Cachar and Sylhet were also called in. On the arrival of troops, pickets were posted to guard the foothills and to meeting the parties in arms and those in concealment for maintaining a desultory warfare.87 On 27 November, Lieutenant Saddler of the 28th Native Infantry aided by Oollung Sallong, a native of Nurtung, effected the seizure of Nongbah at Ompara, 25 miles off Nurtung. He was tried, found guilty of rebellion and was publicly hanged on 30 December 1862. The Syntengs, offered gallant resistance at the stockades of Oomki, Oomkrong and Nongbarai; but against fire of British troops their resistance broke down.88 The stockades fell within a week and the rebels were hunted out in their hideouts. This was followed by the surrender of Sathpunji, Sarthiang and other villages in the north and south-cast. Of the remaining ring leaders, several were killed, some surrendred while a few continued to be at large, but they were too powerless to act against the British troops. The endeavours made by the Syntengs, too, ended in failure and the district was brought, thereafter, under the effective control of a European functionary with headquarters at Jowai.

Agrarian Revolts
The uprisings of 1857 had imposed severe financial strain on the British Indian Government. The deficit in budget in 1858-9 exceeded fourteen million pounds sterling and the public debt shot up to over seventy millions.* The primary concern of the financial advisers of the Government of India for the years following the Mutiny was how to restore order in public accounts or to balance the income and the expenditure. On the advice of James Wilson, in 1860 Income-tax was introduced and this was extended in the following year to the province of Assam. The prospect of obtaining additional allocations becoming extremely bleak, the local authorities in Assam directed their attention to tapping new sources of revenue to meet their increasing expenditure. Despite prohibitory orders of the Court, on the plea of discouraging litigation, stamp duties were introduced in 1858. Excise duties were levied at the sadar stations in Kamrup, Darrang and Nowgong, but not extended to tribal areas on the ground that "establishment required for the purpose would swallow up all the profit".¹ Already washing of gold was farmed out and the jalkar or right to fish in the rivers and beels was offered to the highest bidder. Taxes for cutting timber (gorkhati), reeds (bunker), and grazing tax (khusary) became common.

Excessive use of opium, it was generally believed, had

prising race, into an effiminate, weak, indolent and degraded people". The increase in the cultivation of poppy, out of the juice of which opium was produced, adversely affected the revenues of the government; the bari and chapari lands, in which the crop was generally cultivated was assessed at a lower rate. After lengthy correspondence between the Sadar Board and the local authorities in 1851-2 abkari opium was introduced into Assam. It was vainly hoped, that "when the ryots will have to pay dearly for the drug they will restrict its immoderate use"; for the inveterate consumer will seldom consider himself too poor to purchase it as long as he could have supplies of it. This was welcomed by the planters as this would force the opium-eaters to work in their gardens ; for without it they could not have the drug so essential to them. To make them dependent entirely on government opium, in 1861 cultivation of poppy was totally banned. Already hard hit by the increase in taxation on land, the prohibitory order on opium cultivation shattered the domestic economy of the tribal areas where per capita consumption of opium was stated to be highest in the province.
5
The multiplication of taxes could not but be a matter of serious concern to the agricultural ryots. In the district of Nowgong rumours were afloat that the government was contemplating imposition of taxes on their houses, baries,

In December 1839, Jenkins proposed to raise the tax on land under poppy, but the measure did not receive the approval of the Government of Bengal on the refusal of the Board of Revenue to interfere with the cultivation of land or any restriction on the choice of crops.

(gardens) and pan (betel-leaf) cultivation. Although the official circles dismissed these as "unfounded", the people learnt that much correspondence was going on between the Sadar Board and the district officials on the subject and that Lieutenant Herbert Sconce, the Deputy Commissioner, stood against the measure." About this time the introduction of the License tax confirmed the belief of the villagers, particularly of the tribals at Phulaguri, seven miles from Nowgong, that before long their pan and betel-nut would be subjected to taxation. 8
On 17 September 1861, in order to represent their grievances personally, about one thousand ryots gathered at the Sadar Court and some of them reportedly to have forced their way into the room where the Deputy Commissioner was transacting his business. Instead of allaying their fear and suspicion by explaining the actual motive of the government, Sconce fined and ordered the trespassers to be detained in the thana for their "riotous and disorderly conduct". Through the intervention of a man of influence the party was released the same evening and nothing untoward happened. In a subsequent representation to the Deputy Commissioner on 9 October, the gaoburahs and leading ryots made a formal protest against the prohibition of poppy cultivation and the proposed taxes on their houses, gardens and pan.16 The explanation given by Sconce to satisfy the ryots bore no fruit. "To go to the cutcherry . . . and hope to bring. grievances to the ears of the Hozoor", they were convinced "was out of (the) question". They determined not to pay the taxes and to devise ways and means to bring their grievances to the notice of the authorities. They proposed

to convene a meeting of the mel or assembly of the people which had so long decided matters of their common interest. The meeting was scheduled to be held at Phulaguri on 15 October for five days at a stretch so as to enable the ryots of the remotest villages to take part in its deliberations.
91
12
On receipt of the intelligence that a large number of ryots were preparing to meet at Phulaguri on 14 October, Sconce sent a police daroga with orders to disperse the assembly and arrest the ring leaders. On the 15th, the police party arrived at the place of meeting and ordered the leaders to disperse; but the latter defied, retorting that they were in a meeting to discuss matters of their common interest." Pitted against a crowd of over one thousand, some armed with clubs (lathies), the police retired and reported to the Deputy Commissioner the proceedings of the mel. The police officer who was despatched on the following day also utterly failed to disperse the "unlawful assembly". ssembly". On the 17th the daroga arrested some of the leaders, but the mob overpowered him and succeeded in releasing the arrested leaders. The Deputy Commissioner was told that unless stringent measures were taken to drive the crowd no one would be able to do anything without the risk of one's life.13
Considering the situation rather serious, on the 18th Lieutenant Singer, the Assistant Commissioner, under direction of the Deputy Commissioner accompanied by a police party arrived at Phulaguri and found therein a gathering of over three thousand, many armed with lathies." After parleys with some leaders Singer ordered the assembled ryots to lay down their arms and disperse. Some of them promptly obeyed, the majority heeded not, and acted contumaciously. Not only did Singer order the police to forcibly disarm the rebels but foolishly attempted to seize himseslf the lathies in their possession. A scuffle ensued and cries were raised

dhuro dhuro, maro maro (seize, seize, kill kill); and in the midst of this a blow from behind struck Singer down to the ground; and the police party, being greatly alarmed took to their heels. Singer was beaten to death and his body was thrown into the river Kalang.¹ 15
At Nowgong, the Deputy Commissioner had but twenty five sepoys of the Assam Light Infantry. He felt his position insecure when it was rumoured that the disaffected ryots would soon arrive, burn down the station and loot the treasury. Immediately on receipt of the news of the incident, he hastened a party of police under a havildar and sent an urgent communique to the Deputy Commissioner, Darrang, calling for reinforcement. 16 On the arrival of the police party at Phulaguri, in the early hours on the 19th, a skirmish followed in which with their bows and arrows the ryots could but offer feeble resistance to the fire of the police and several of them died and many were left wounded. Fortunately the same evening, on his way to Dibrugarh Henry Hopkinson, the Commissioner of Assam, arrived at Tezpur on board the Lucknow. He made immediate arrangement for despatch of troops from Tezpur and himself arrived at Nowgong on 23rd with a party of the Assam Light Infantry.¹7 Emboldened thus, the Deputy Commissioner visited Phulaguri, Neli, Kachuhat, Raha and several other places and effected the arrest of forty one persons including sons of the "old Lalung

The Police mohurrer reported that under orders of Singer he had bound up the hands of two men, and Singer himself had endeavoured to seize the lathies of one Moira Singh. While both of them were pulling the stick in opposite direction, the two men whose hands were tied asked their fellowmen if they were going to desert them. Hardly had the mob raised their sticks to reply in the negative, when one Bahoo of the Koshigpur mouza felled down Singer to the ground by a single blow on the head. Of those concerned in the murder, the mohurrer mentioned the names of Bahoo, Kati Lalung, Thomba Lalung, Jobo Lalung, Katia Lalung, Mohi Koch and Koli Deka.

Rajas" alleged to have been implicated in the murder of Singer.¹8 But for the timely arrival of the military and police, it was feared, the disturbance would have spread to other quarters. "The beginning of a tumult" remarked Hopkinson, the Commissioner of Assam "is like the letting out of water if not stopped at first, it becomes difficult to afterwards".19
SO
Hopkinson traced the origin of the outbreak to the imposition of the Income-tax and to an "unfounded apprehension" of the nature of taxation to be levied on pan, and to some extent of the License tax.20 This was treated as "sweeping conclusions" by Sir Cecil Beadon, the Licutenant Governor of Bengal, who considered the meeting at Phulaguri leading to Singer's murder to be due entirely to local causes. Ile was convinced that if the ryots had been properly tackled by the Deputy Commissioner "by personally meeting them and attending to their grievances, they would have in all probability peacefully dispersed and accepted the unavoidable financial measures of the Government in a spirit of loyal acquiescence and submission to authority His deputation of the police and subsequently of an inexperienced young officer with so small a force and without clear instruction to him not to resort to coercive measures was an act of great imprudence. In conclusion, the Lieutenant Governor was constrained to remark :

"I do not think", remarked Hopkinson, "that it is the amount levied from them not much the manner in which it has been collected, but it is the principle on which, in their understanding it is based that has so greatly alarmed them; they regard it as an assumption of the right of the dominant power to make inquisition into everyman's property, four per cent now, forty per cent hereafter perhaps ...". 21 Ibid., Lushington to Agnew, 31 May 1862.

sonment, justly indeed but under circumstances which cannot fail to make them the objects of sympathy to their fellow villagers and of compassion to all.22
The Phulaguri affair should not be glossed over as a mere riot of local nature without any consequence whatever; nor should it be taken as a dhawa or regular battle as has been styled by some writers.23 It would also be far from the truth to say that it was a movement of the tribals alone. There is hardly any doubt that the Lalungs and Kacharis of Nowgong being hard hit by the prohibitory measures of government were in the vanguard of the movement; but they were blessed, if not actively cooperated with by educated and well-to-do middle class consisting of small land owners, government servants, mouzadars, traders and merchants who were no less affected by recent taxes on income, trades and dealings. The uprising at Phulaguri was the earliest popular movement in Assam organised with the object of compelling the government to yield to the will of the people by the withdrawal of unpopular measures of taxation. The movement failed and was bound to fail under existing circumstances; but the precedent was not lost upon the people; it was followed up soon after.
In spite of the growing discontent of the ryots, the authorities in Calcutta as well as in Assam never ceased to impose new taxes and increase the existing rates in revenue on land. In 1861, Hopkinson sought to double the tax on land on the plea of utilizing the excess revenue on works of public utility. Although the proposal did not receive the approval of the Board of revenue, the latter agreed to the recommendation made carlier by Jenkins that an additional fund be created for the repair and reconstruction of roads, bridges, etc. In 1865, Hopkinson renewed his proposal in
a different form proposing to raise the revenue on land with

the object of equalising the rates in all the districts. The difference in rates, he argued, had encouraged migratory habits of the ryots by drawing them away from the areas of heavier taxation to those where assessment was light.26 He also wanted to raise the rates of "household and garden lands" since the produce of these lands, viz. betel-nut commanded a ready sale on the spot at a higher profit. Hopkinson's proposal, on this occasion, received the approval of the Government of Bengal and, consequently, rates of rupit and non-rupit lands increased from 25 to 50 per cent in almost all the districts.27
The ryots of Patharughat in the Mangaldai sub-division were the first to react against the enhancement of revenues on land. The aggrieved, both Hindus and Mussalmans, met in their mels and protested against the new measures. Anticipating troubles, Colonel A. C. Comber, Deputy Commissioner, Darrang, accompanied by the Superintendent of Police arrived at Patharughat, and on that very night the party was besieged by a huge crowd; but nothing untoward happened since neither side took the offensive. 28 From early 1869, mels were frequently held at Gobindapur, Hadira and Bajali in the north of the district of Kamrup. Towards the end of January Mr. Campbell, the Sub-divisional officer, Barpeta, was informed that about four thousand people had gathered at Gobindapur to protest against the recent enhancement of revenue on land.29 The Police Inspector, Barpeta, was directed immediatedly to proceed to the spot to inquire about the proceedings of the mel and to find out the ring leaders. Since he had only a few men with muskets, the Inspector dared not go against the assembly of the people. Under cover of darkness he passed through Gobindapur and collected from hearsay information the names of a few leaders, but failed

to furnish particulars about the mel which the Deputy Commissioner needed to bring the offenders to book. The inefficiency of police as exhibited in Gobindapur affair received condemnation of Major Agnew, the officiating Commissioner of Assam, who desired that the officer concerned should allow no more time to mobs of such kind to assemble.30 The repressive measures subsequently enforced discouraged the ryots from holding regular mels, but the smouldering ambers of discontent lay dormant and manifested itself occasionally in the gatherings at namghars and mosques.
No outward movement of a serious nature occurred for nearly two decades. The matter, however, came to a head in 1892 when Sir William Ward, the Chief Commissioner Assam, in the new settlement raised the rates of revenue on land to 70 to 80 per cent, and in some cases 100 per cent.³1 A no tax campaign on a vigorous scale was launched by the ryots of Rangia and Lachima in the district of Kamrup and Patharughat in Darrang." During the month of December people belonging to the tahsils of Pati Darrang, Nalbari, Barama, Bajali, and also of the five mouzas of Upper Borbhag and Sarukhetri in their mels resolved not to yield to the government demand and to fine and excommunicate those who

Thus in a meeting at Naogaon in Pati Darrang, on 28 December 1893, the assembly (Rais) threatened one Bijoy Choudhury who had paid a revenue of Rs. 25 and fined him a similar amount. In another meeting on 9 January 1894, the ryots made a vow that any one giving evidence in favour of Bijoy Choudhury would be excommunicated. In a meeting at Tengapani, Pati Darrang, 4 January 1894, resolutions were passed (i) not to pay revenue, (ii) to avenge themselves on whoever attempted to attach their property.

a mel at Belagaon, a village near Rangia, the mob destroyed the huts at the Rangia bazar and threatened a Marwari (Keya) shopkeeper that his shop would be looted on the 30th on the ground that "their (Keyas') presence had caused enhancement of land revenue".34
97
On 30 December, actually a crowd estimated at about three thousand assembled at Rangia, held demonstration throughout the night and threatened that they would destroy the thana, post office and the tahsildar's bunglow. The timely arrival of armed police saved the situation. On 6 January 1893, R. B. McCabe, the Deputy Commissioner, Kamrup, with a party of police arrived at Rangia and succeeded in arresting a number of persons alleged to have been implicated in the incident on 24 December. On 10 January, a crowd of about three thousand, some armed with clubs, assembled at the open field near the thana. When they were asked by the Deputy Commissioner to disperse, not only did they disobey, but were gradually drawing nearer to the thana with cries "we won't pay revenue at the enhanced rate". In the evening they attempted to release the arrested men by forcing their way into the thana and had actually occupied a few houses within it, whereupon the police resorted to firing which compelled them to disperse.³5
The determined resistance of the ryots and the apprehension of further troubles compelled McCabe to strengthen security measures. He called for additional troops from Tezpur and the Daranga frontier. The tahsildar's cutcherry was strongly stockaded and orders were issued for the attachment of all licensed guns in the disturbed areas-Rangia, Nalbari, Barama, Bajali. Without previous permission of the Deputy Commissioner meetings of the mels were banned*.

Leaders of the affected areas were appointed as special constables with the object of maintaining peace and in assisting in the collection of revenues of the government.36 These measures resulted in a return to normalcy at Rangia where in a few days, of the total demand of Rs. 90,000 of the first instalment an amount of Rs. 60,000 was realised. But at Nalbari, Barama and Bajali the mels continued to be as active as before and there the ryots were placed as it were in between two fircs. McCabe reported:
AGRARIAN REVOLTS
The unfortunate ryot who has to pay his revenue is met by the tahsildur on one side who says "if you do not pay, your property will be attached, and on the other side by the Rais i.e. the embodiment of the order of the mel, which states "if you pay you are cursed and excommunicated". He has therefore to face loss of property on the one side or social ostracism on the other :37
At Bajali the mel appointed its own dak (post) peons to carry its orders from one village to another and organised a corps of clubsmen (lathials) to resist attachment of property. The ryots were warned with dire consequences, against accepting auctioned property of their fellow villagers.38 On 21 January 1894, when a mouzadar accompanied by a mandal went to village Kapla, near Lachima in the Sarukhetri mouza, for collection of revenuc, both of them were severely assaulted and the mouzadar died a few days afterwards. For interrogation and investigation seventy five persons were arrested by the police, but a mob forcibly effected their relcase. The threatening attitude of the ryots in a subsequent mel compelled McCabe to arrive at Lachima on the 24th with a party of sepoys of the 13th Bengal Native Infantry.39 Hardly had he effected the arrest of 59 persons and lodged them up in a

temporary lock-up, when a huge crowd gathered in front of his camp. The latter submitted a petition, stated to have been signed by six thousand ryots demanding release of their comrades and declining payment of revenue. On the refusal of the Deputy Commissioner to accede to their demands the mob rushed towards him, but they were kept at bay and later driven out by the sepoys.10
99
Simultaneously, troubles of a serious nature broke out again at Patharughat which was not more than twelve miles from the border of Kamrup. Since the middle of January, the ryots assembled in their mels for several days not only to protest against the increase in rates of revenue but also to resist those who would be paying revenue to the government.¹¹ On receipt of the information, J. D. Anderson, the Deputy Commissioner, Darrang, arrived at Patharughat on 27 January with a party of military police under Lieutenant Berrington. The next morning when the police party under Berrington proceeded to attach the property of a defaulting ryot, they were surrounded by a mob of about two hundred. Berrington and his men somehow managed to escape and reported the matter to the Deputy Commissioner. A few hours afterwards about tho thousand ryots thronged in front of the rest house where Anderson was encamping. In spite of his orders to leave the place, the mob continued to advance towards him throwing sticks and clods of earth. Berrington was ordered to open fire. Thereupon, the police chased the ryots firing continuously along the Mangaldai road and scores of them lay dead and wounded.12

AGRARIAN REVOLTS
A survey of the uprisings described in the foregoing pages will reveal that the revenue policy of the Government of Assam caused widespread discontentment amongst the agricultural ryots. The manner in which settlement of temporarily settled areas was conducted was "arbitrary and unjust". The classification of land was neither scientific nor based on actual productivity of the soil. The anomalies in the revenue system had been described by a correspondent of the Indian Nation as follows:
Formerly the Assam ryot was the proprietor of his land. If he made any default to pay revenue, his land was sold at auction, the surplus of the sale proceeds being paid to him after deducting arrear costs. But at present he is neither a landholder, a settlement-holder or a tenant-at-will liable to be ejected or to have his lease cancelled on breach of any of the conditions of lease.
At present the ryot cannot transfer his land to another without permission of the Deputy Commissioner. Formerly there was no such restriction.
The number of pattas or lease has been multiplied and the ryot may have from five to ten pattus. For a single cottah of land, if it be situated near a public road, a patta bearing an eight anna stamp may be demanded.
The burdens which now press upon the land in Assam ure considerably heavier than on land owned by zamindurs in Bengal.
That the rates of assessment were exhorbitant is borne out by the fact that the Chief Commissioner himself had been forced to reduce it by 26% at the first instance and subsequently by a further percentage.44 Not satisfied with the token reduction, the ryots demanded postponment of collection until the representation which they made to the Government of India was formally disposed of. At a public meeting held at Sibsagar the inhabitants vehemently resented the sudden increase of revenue to the extent of twenty four per cent
was impossible to ascertain the exact number of casualties from a distance of 250 yards. That the number of wounded was heavier is evident from the fact that special constables were asked to persuade the ryots to take their comrades to the Mangaldai dispensary.

per pura as there was nothing in the agricultural and commercial aspect of Sibsagar town to warrant such an enhancement. The Jorhat Sarbajanik Sabha and the Ryot Sabha of Tezpur and Nowgong ventilated popular grievances against the fiscal measures of the government. The Chief Commissioner remained unmoved; he "made no attempt to take the people into confidence, to disarm their suspicions, to hold out hopes",45 and hence followed the untoward events which took a heavy toll of human lives.
101
Though belatedly, the Government of India reduced the rates at first to 53% and later to 32.7%. "It is a pity", remarked the contemporary press, that "the order of abatement did not reach sooner, in which case there would in all probability have (bcen) no riots". "It is a lamentable instance of tardiness where promptness was the first requisite-a glaring proof of red-tapism".4
The popular uprising, the "Assam riots" as it was called by the official circles, was considered by the press "as a very serious affair" and the manner of suppressing them was regarded as even more scrious.48 The Indian Nation in its issue on 21 April of 1894 described the grievances of the people as "real and not sentimental". The paper rightly commented that "people complain not of loss of rights and privileges, not of a lowering of status, but of a material wrong in the shape of enhancement of revenue". "Force was employed, and this went for to bring about forcible resistance on the part of the people, and the use of fire arms by the government.49 The Amrita Bazar Patrika observed in its cditorial that "in the Deccan the fury of the ryots was directed against money-lenders, in Bengal against indigo-planters in 1860, in Pabna against zamindars in 1872, but in Assam, at

this movement, it is open rebellion against the Government"." The protests of the people through press and platform had their echo in the Imperial Legislature. At its meeting on 29 March 1894, Dr. Rash Behari Ghosh put as many as eight questions on the "Assam Riots". He questioned the propriety of the new assessment, the repressive policy adopted by the local authorities and the appointment of respectable persons as special constables for the purpose of collecting taxes and attaching defaulters' properties.51 The replies given to these by the government were vague and unsatisfactory. They were considered as "misleading and inconsistent with facts" by leading newspapers of the time.52 The Government of India might have laid the blame on the people while exonerating itself and the provincial administration for all acts of ommission and commission, but the repressive measures undertaken to suppress the popular movement could not but tarnish the fair name of any civilised government.

English Education
It was no small compliment to Major Jenkins that he realised soon after his assumption of office that the natives of the soil must be relied on and that it was up to the government to train them up to take up positions of trust and responsibility. Being alarmed at the sight of non-Assainese in almost all the government offices he brought home to the Government of India that the "old families of Assam are still losing influence in their own native province being elbowed (out from) those situations which lead to power or decent influence". This state of affairs, he was afraid, was "pregnant with serious consequences; and this could be remedied by no other means than the government taking "some active steps" to provide instructions for the Assamese youths, for when the upper classes will perceive that
There is no other road to distinction than through the attainment of superior information and the means of procuring it for their children is put within their reach, they will not allow to be surpassed by those of the inferior ranks.¹
The indigenous system of education continued to exist in Assam even after the period of civil wars and invasions in a number of satras, tols and pathsalas where instructions imparted were mostly of religious nature leading to a pious life and not so much for any useful purpose or widening the mental horizon. To encourage this system of education, in October 1826, with the approval of the Government of India, Scott established eleven schools by assignment of lands mostly in Lower Assam where "the only language taught is Sanskrit and the matter

saster."2 Adam White in collaboration with James Rae, a Christian missionary, founded another school in 1831 at Gauhati where in addition to the existing courses of studies, Bengali translation of English works on elementary science formed a part of the curriculum.³ In 1833, with the aid of the Moravians' Society Robertson sought to establish a number of institutions with the object of imparting practical knowledge rather than theological lessons, but the scheme was considered "too revolutionary" to be acceptable to the authorities in Calcutta. An invitation to the Moravians, it was feared, would be tantamount to the encouragement to mission activities which would be in direct contravention to the principles of religious neutrality so long followed by the East-India Company.
Jenkins conceived that in a backward province like Assam education should be a State responsibility. "To (en-) trust the diffusion of knowledge. . . to natives of the country would be to protract for centuries what with our aid may be performed in a brief period of years." He therefore strongly urged the Government of India in his letter of 21 June 1834 for the establishment of English schools under supervision of European functionaries at the Sadar stations-Goalpara, Gauhati, Nowgong, Darrang and Bishwanath. For necessary training, a number of Assamese youths of rank should be sent to Calcutta and provisionally teachers capable of teaching English and Bengali would have to be procured from Bengal. The school buildings would be constructed at a little expense by convicts of the local jail. The total cost of the entire scheme was estimated at Rs. 12,000.

Until the early years of the nineteenth century, the attitude of the East-India Company towards education of the Indians was one of total indifference. The Charter Act of 1813, however, made education a responsibility of the Company's government and set apart for each year lakh of rupees for the
105
"revival and improvement of literature and the encouragement of learned natives of India and for the introduction and promotion of a knowledge of science amongst the inhabitants of the British territories in India". It was not until the appointment of the General Committee of Public Instruction in 1823 that definite steps were taken for the promotion of education of the natives of India. Hardly had the committee started activities, when opinions were divided even amongst its members as to amount earmarked for education should be spent for the promotion of oriental learning or for the spread of education through the medium of English. The controversy between the two groups-the Orientalists and the Anglicists-reached a head on the arrival of Macaulay, in carly 1835, as the President of the General Committee of Public Instruction. On the basis of the minute submitted by Macaulay, the Governor-General in Council resolved on 7 March 1835 that "The great object of the British Government ought to be the promotion of European literature and science amongst the natives of India and that all the funds appropriated for the purposes of education would be best employed on English education alone."
The proposal submitted by Jenkins reached the General Committee of Public Instruction at the opportune moment. The latter accorded its approval in June 1835 for the establishment of an English school at Gauhati and in the next month appointed Mr. Singer, its Headmaster on a salary of Rs. 150 a month. Towards the close of the same year the school (now Collegiate High School) had its start with an enrolment of 58 students. The number increased to 150 in 1838 and 380 at the end of 1840. Since the Gauhati School was not accessible to the pupils of Upper Assam, for the education of the sons

of the Ahom royal family and the gentry of the realm, Brodie proposed to establish an English school at the sadar station and branch schools at Jaypur and Jorhat. Paucity of funds postponed the scheme from being implemented until 1841, when an English school was started at Sibsagar with Mr. D. S'ouza as its Headmaster. In the meantime William Robinson replaced Singer as the Headmaster of Gauhati school.8
ENGLISH EDUCATION
True to the expectations of Jenkins, when the portals of public service were thrown open only to those who were educated, the higher classes not only showed their eagerness to get their sons educated, but many of them became patrons of education. The increasing demand for English education led to the opening of a number of branch schools entirely at public expense in the neighbourhood of Gauhati-Pandu, Kamakhya, Beltola, Amingaon and North Gauhati.¹0 Although owing to the general poverty and ignorance of the people, men in rural areas were "content to live and die as their forefather's did"many desired to have rudiments of education should opportunities be available nearer home. The demand became all the more stronger with the introduction of the new revenue measures in 1833-4 requiring the services of a number of minor revenue officers-the thakurias, gaon kakaties, etc. The introduction of written pattas also aroused a curiousity and created the necessity even amongst the ignorant masses in the interior to have the knowledge of the three R's lest they be deceived by the corrupt amlahs of the court. To cater to this growing demand, in 1838 James Matthie, the Collector of Kamrup laid before the government a scheme of village schools under which existing indigenous institutions were to be developed to impart instructions to the masses in reading, writing

and arithmetic.1¹¹ In spite of eloquent support of the educationist like Adam, Munro and Elphiustone, the attitude of the General Committee of Public Instruction towards mass education was far from being favourable. It strictly followed the so-called filtration theory-that education should spread gradually from the higher to the lower classes and therefore the Gauhati school should produce a class of local instructors through whose agency the benefits of similar education should percolate to the masses. Approval of Matthie's proposal was thus out of the question; but on the strong recommendation of the President-in Council, "as an experimental measure", the scheme received the sanction of the Supreme Government." While vernacular education was entirely neglected in Bengal and elsewhere, it received encouragement in the hands of the local authorities in Assam. In August 1835, twentyone village schools were established in Kamrup and similar schools were set up in the next two years at Darrang and Nowgong. By 1843, the number of village schools stood at twelve in Nowgong, five in Darrang and twenty two in Kamrup.¹

Though inspired by a proselytising spirit, the contribution made by the Christian Missionaries to the promotion of education in Assam was unique. On 6 January 1837, Reverend Nathan Brown and Reverend Oliver Cutter started a school at Sadiya, and within a week twenty pupils enrolled themselves with an eagerness that was "truly astonishing".¹4 By 1845, the American Baptist Missionaries started three schools in

Concurring in this view, the Supreme Government sanctioned an amount of Rs. 64 for the establishment of three vernacular schools at Darrang, Chatgari and Tezpur.

Nowgong, five in Kamrup and fourteen in Sibsagar with an average attendance of 347 students. 15 The Welsh Missionaries who had commenced their activities in the Khasi-Jayantia Hills had about a dozen schools to their credit.¹6 The Missionaries preferred Assamese to English as medium and for this they learnt the regional language, translated English works into vernacular and published books for the use of the pupils. Besides religious lessons the Christian teachers imparted instructions in the three R's and usually on some useful arts. Bronson opened up an industrial school at Namsang and another at Nowgong. 17
With the exception of the mission schools where Assamese was the medium, lessous were imparted generally in village schools in Bengali covering elements of reading, writing and arithmetic while at the sadar schools there were two independent departments-English and Bengali.¹8 Subjects taught in the junior classes were Wilson's Chronology, Yates' Elements of Natural Philosophy, English Grammar, the use of globes, arithmetic, and translation and composition; while the curriculum of the senior classes consisted of Marshman's History of India, Homer's Iliad by Pope, Elements of Natural Philosophy, geography, arithmetic up to vulgar fractions, and compositions and translation. Provisions were also made for the teaching of the classical subjects, Sanskrit, Arabic and Persian.¹⁹
Evidently, attempts were made to provide liberal education to the Assamese pupils. Every emphasis was however laid from the very beginning on the study of English and in fact the lure of jobs attracted most of the students to the English department. It was however found extremely difficult

on the part of the beginners to learn English both as a subject and language of instruction. This was evident in the very first year of the Gauhati school when several students did not turn up after admission on account of the unintelligibility of the English language*. There was a rapid fall in enrolment and it dwindled to such an extent that in 1844 the Government of Bengal thought it desirable to make teaching of English optional. Consequently both the schools at Gauhati and Sibsagar were converted into Anglo-Vernacular schools.20 Improvement of English schools posing too difficult a problem. the local authoritics directed their attention to augment the number of vernacular schools for the spread of education. As a result the number of vernacular schools increased in 1852 to 74 with an enrolment of 4025; of these 26 schools were in Kamrup, 13 in Nowgong, 9 each in the districts of Sibsagar and Nowgong.2¹ Until 1856-7, in Cachar there was not a school worth the name. In 1865-6 there were seven schools in existence. The position was slightly better in Sylhet which had 28 schools with an enrolment of 1127 students.22
109
In 1841, with a view to effecting “a vigilant control" and introducing "a uniform system of instruction" William Robinson, the Ileadmaster of the Gauhati school, was made the Inspector of Schools.23 The appointment did not find favour with the Collectors who felt that they would have no more control over educational institutions in their jurisdictions. On the otherhand, the teachers and the taught were also not satisfied since they lost the prospect of being personally brought
This was remedied in the next year by the introduction of three departments Bengali, Sanskrit and Persian. As a result enrolment increased next year to 111 of whom 77 Hindus, 33 Muhammedans and 3 Christians. RPIB., 1855-6, p. 32.

into notice of the Collectors in whose hands lay the whole patronage of appointments, the only inducement for education. As a remedy although the Inspector was made primarily responsible for public instruction, the local authoritics were also authorised to visit the schools so as to bring irregularities and abuses to the notice of the Inspector and to give every encouragement to the people to avail themselves of the means provided by the government. In spite of this dual supervision
21
the schools were conducted according to no system or each had a system of its own. In most of the village schools masters kept no register of daily attendance nor had (they) a list of pupils even. The book of instruction was issued, but it was seldom opened; neither was there a fixed curriculum nor any list of text-books and, in fact, text books were so scarce that the teachers were compelled to devote much of their time to writing letters, petitions and keeping accounts or engaged in religious studies.25
Consequently, as Robinson reported,
Even the most advanced students were just able to read only a few pages of their text-books without any comprehension whatever of their meaning and not unoften the teacher himself ... their handwriting illegible, orthography much worse, of arithmetic they literally knew nothing.20
The knowledge which they acquire seldom makes them fit for any other duty than those of a gaon kakati. As to the attainment at the sadar schools it was equally disappointing. Until 1854, "not a single student has been able to acquire even the standard laid down for junior scholarships in the Government Schools and Colleges."27
Wood's Despatch of 1854 laid the foundation of modern system of education in India. It repudiated the filtration theory -that education should spread from the higher to the lower

stratum in society and recommended instead education of the masses through a number of High Schools, Middle Schools and Primary Schools to be supported by grant-in-aid. With the object of diffusing "useful and practical knowledge" to the masses, accordingly, endeavours had been made in Assam to establish a number of self-supporting indigenous schools on grant-in-aid basis.28 Under the scheme of Subsidy Schools rewards were offered to teachers to attract larger number of pupils to their shcools to acquire the rudiments of the three R's.29 To raise the standard of teaching, on the suggestions made by Mills, the number of primary schools was reduced. in 1860 from seventytwo to twentyone and later to sixteen despite protests made by the guardians to send their wards to far off places for receiving education in the government schools. To compensate this, in 1870-1 grant-in-aid to selfsupporting schools was raised and the number of these institutions also increased to 166 with 5278 pupils on the rolls.30
111
The slow progress of English education at the Gauhati school created a notion in the minds of the local authorities that the "Assamese would never improve in European knowledge" 31 This was strongly refuted by Dhekial Phukan in his Observation on the Administration of the Province of Assam which he submitted to Mills in 1853. He rightly pointed out that it would be both unfair and unjust to judge the capacity of a people to receive improvements from the trial of a period not exceeding five or six years and that the slow progress of English education in Assam must be traced more to the defects of the system than to the want of zeal and promptitude on the part of the students. He made it clear to Mills that the people, particularly the upper classes, were anxious to educate their sons on the knowledge of western science and literature

which was borne out by the fact that despite too many difficulties several students had already been sent to the Presidency for higher education.³2
In fact, since the sixties there had been a persistent demand from the public for the establishment of English schools,33 for it was obvious to them that with the knowledge of the three R's they could not aspire after any other job than copyists, clerks or accountants. What they demanded was not merely English education, but instruction of a higher order to make them eligible for lucrative posts under the government. Robinson says
The boys now see that medium attainments will not suffice to secure the better class of appointments now being thrown open to them, and the result I am happy to see is a (desire) for a higher standard of education in the almost certain hope that "the race is to be strong", and that better the qualification, the better now the chance of employment.³4
35
For the establishment of a High School or College representations were made to the Lieutenant Governor of Bengal when the latter paid a visit to Assam in 1862.³5 When there was thus a rising tide in favour of higher English education, the local authorities had to change their attitude and to support the public demand. As early as August 1855, G.F.F. Vincent, the Collector of Darrang, urged the Inspector of Schools to establish a college somewhere in Assam having separate departments of humanities, agriculture, medicine and

<content>Early Collegiate Education Its Failure
lysing the difficulties faced by the Assamese students in their pursuit of higher education in Calcutta, Robinson pressed for the establishment of a provincial college in Assam.³7 In October 1864, Mr. Murray, who succeeded Robinson as the Inspector of Schools, also laid stress on the necessity of making some provision for collegiate education in Assam. Such a measure, he brought home to the Government of Bengal, apart from giving a stimulus to higher education would obviate the necessity of importing at a higher salary subordinate officers, even ordinary school masters from Bengal. Realising however that the government may not be agreeable to provide an expensive college for the handful of students then coming out from the two schools at Gauhati and Sibsagar, he proposed to raise up the standard of the Gauhati School to the F.A. Course of the Calcutta University. The proposal appeared to be so convincing that the Government of India readily accorded its approval to the measure. The Gauhati School was to be raised to a Collegiate School with an establishment of Rs. 12,000 per annum.
38
In May 1866, with the high hopes the collegiate section was started at the Gauhati School; but from the outset its prospects were far from being promising. Since the number of successful candidates at Entrance Examination was small, the enrolment at the collegiate section was bound to be poor. In 1870-1, the total enrolment stood at seventeen; it dwindled to seven in 1875-6.39 Consequently, the cost of education of a pupil at the Collegiate school was comparatively much higher at Gauhati than in an institution where numerical strength was higher. In 1874-5, per capita expenditure of a college student at Gauhati stood at Rs. 1,086 whereas at the Presidency College, Calcutta Rs. 210, Patna College Rs. 498 and Cuttack

High School Rs. 408.40 What ultimately led the authorities to revert the Gauhati school to its earlier status was its disappointing results; in 1869-70, of the two candidates who appeared at the F. A. Examination one passed, but during the years 1872-4, not a single candidate could come out successful in the University examination.¹1
The failure of the collegiate experiment was the true index of Secondary or High School education in Assam. Without an increase in the number of feeder institutions it was vain to expect the success of the higher education. Even from the existing institution a tolerably good number of successful candidates would have been forthcoming if the instructions were imparted effectively by teachers duly qualified for the job. "With the same money allowed for the schools in Bengal", with regret Murray reported, "we have to send for inferior men from Dacca and Calcutta for higher posts and are obliged to be content with the teachers for the lower classes who know little more than a smattering of anything." The pay that was offered to a teacher was also extremely meagre. "It is certain", reported Porter, the Inspector of Schools, "that no competent men will be willing to come from Bengal on Rs. 20 or Rs. 25 per month. ¹3 Added to this was the difficulty of a foreign medium of instruction. Though English was made optional in 1844, with the affiliation of the Gauhati English School to the Entrance Examination of the Calcutta University in 1858, English was reintroduced as a compulsory subject both in the Higher and Middle English

Schools from the lowest classes, and in the former it was also used as a medium of instructions. The study of the subject began even before the pupils had a fair knowledge of his own vernacular. As a result, "their education was sound neither in English nor in vernacular nor in the subject studied through these media"," What was worse, the recognised vernacular was not the mother tongue, but Bengali, a foreign language. The continuance of Bengali as the Court language might have given in subordinate officers and those in constant touch with them, a working knowledge of the language, but to the masses, the young pupils in particular, the foreign vernacular proved to be the most formidable obstacle in the progress of education. Mills noticed this anomally in 1853 when he strongly recommended to the Council of Education* immediate substitution of Bengali by Assamese with the remark that "an English youth is not taught Latin until he is well grounded in English, and in the same manner, an Assamese should not be taught a foreign language until he knows his own".15

The emergence of a separate Directorate of Education in Assam following the reconstitution of the province in 1874, naturally, raised high hopes in the minds of the educated youths that the cause of higher education would receive adequate justice in the hands of the authorities. Their hopes were not entirely belied. The untiring efforts of the Assamese public, the whole-hearted cooperation of the American Missionarics and the strongest recommendations made by some of the high officials led the Lieutenant Governor of Bengal in 1873 to

In a similar strain G.F.F., Vincent, Collector of Darrang, suggested that, "in lieu of the present Mongrel dialect of half Assamese and half Bengali, the Assamese language be taught in the schools, the pundits of which should be all natives of the country (and) no foreigner being on any account whatever, preferred to such a situation.

make Assamese the language of the court and schools in Assam. Thanks to the cooperation of the unofficials and officials, the initial difficulties arising out of the scarcity of textbooks was gradually removed by the publication of a series of suitable text-books on various subjects for the Assamese pupils. The English schools were also on the increase. In 1881-2, the total number of High Schools, including those of the Surma Valley, was eleven with an enrolment of 2264 and of Middle English Schools thirtyseven with 2929 pupils on the rolls. Since 1880 there was also a steady increase in the percentage of successful candidates in the Entranco
Examinations.

It dawned upon the English educated youths that even the high offices in the State could not be a monopoly of tho non-Assamese or the Englishmen and that of right the sons of the soil must have the major share in them. The agitation centred in the beginning not so much in capturing a number of posts but in acquiring the means of getting the requisite qualification for them. The last quarter of the 19th century, therefore, saw not only an increase in the number of English Schools on private enterprise, but also an organised move for the promotion of collegiate education. Stressing on the difficulties experienced by the Assamese students in Calcutta, in 1878 the educated public represented to Sir Steuart Bailey, the Chief Commissioner of Assam, for the re-opening of the collegiate classes at the Gauhati school and the latter, too, expressed his willingness to do so provided the public would raise half of the funds required for the purpose which was at that age unthinkable.49 Sir Charles Elliott, Bailey's successor, considered the question of re-opening of the college classes if the university results continued to be satisfactory; pending that he raised the value of the scholarships to rupees

twenty to be awarded to all Assamese students who would proceed for higher education at any college in Bengal. The increase in value and number of scholarship for a time silenced the public, but in 1887 William Ward, the then Chief Commissioner reduced the number of scholarships to fourteen diverting the funds to scholarships for studies in the Medical and Engineering colleges in Calcutta.5¹
The reduction in the number of scholarships without a further move on the part of the government to implement the collegiate scheme as assured by Elliott led to a renewal of the agitation. Although the majority still demanded that the college should be established at Gauhati, a section of the people wanted it to be located either at Sibsagar or Jorhat since Gauhati was neither healthier nor centrical; while a few others opined that the Assamese students would get a sounder education only in Bengal and that "secing something of this world would enlarge their ideas". But such hopes remained unfulfilled, it was argued, since Assamese students who proceeded to Calcutta formed a coterie amongst themselves without mixing with others which prevented them from having a broader outlook. It was also too much to expect a higher standard of education when majority of them resorted to private colleges where standard of teaching and disciplino was far from being satisfactory. The conflicting views as to the establishment of a college, its location and no less the financial implication it would involve, postponed the final decision of the government on the subject.
52

The attention of the government was not drawn until Manik Chandra Baruah, an eminent Assamese of the age, in his memorial on 28 March 1899, made out a strong case for the establishment of a second-grade college at Gauhati. Baruah represented :
Assam is the only province which has not got a college. Indeed, it has not a high institution worth the name. A college

at Gauhati with a European Principal will be better appreciated by the students than similar private institutions (owned by native gentlemen) to which they generally resort.53
Refuting the arguments of his opponents, Baruah added that Gauhati would be the ideal location for the college; it was easier for the people of Upper Assam to come down stream to Gauhati than for those of Lower Assam to go up to Sibsagar or Dibrugarh. It is nearer to Bengal than any other sadar station and with the completion of the railways on the north bank it will be directly connected with Calcutta. Gauhati was unhealthy, he admitted, owing to Kala-azar, from the ravages of which there will be no escape in the near future even in Upper Assam.51
What Baruah sincerely desired was that the higher education of the Assamese youths should not suffer under any circumstances. If the government was of the opinion that the time was not ripe for consideration of a college at Gauhati, Baruah emphasised the urgency of establishing a hostel for Assamese students in Calcutta.55 The strongest support came from the then Chief Commissioner Sir Henry John Stedman Cotton-one of the most popular, far-sighted and liberal-minded civilians whom England had sent out to India. In consideration of the difference in opinion as to the establishment of the college, its location and mainly to discourage the spirit of provincialism which was then rife, the Chief Commissioner emphasised that Assamese students should proceed for higher education to Bengal. "They are dependent on Bengal as Welshmen are dependent on England." That "such dependence is not inconsistent with a truly national sentiment".56 Sir Henry, therefore, proposed in lieu of a local college, a hostel for Assamese students in Calcutta under proper supervision. However without ascertaining the views of the public, he was not prepared to go ahead with his own scheme. In response to

his circular letters, representations poured in from all quarters and to the amazement of the Chief Commissioner unanimously favouring the college, and not a hostel in Calcutta.7 Without any mental reservation, Sir Henry accepted the people's verdict.58 In spite of the financial crisis in the wake of the great carthquake of 1897, he took immediate steps to lay the foundation of the college that has been gratefully named after him and that was destined to be the alma mater and a common forum of the youths of the hills and plains in Assam.
119
The Cotton College was formally opened by the Chief Commissioner on 20 June 1900. Under the inspiring guidance of a galaxy of eminent teachers and untiring exertions of the Principal F. W. Sudmersen who identified himself with the college, it became in less than a decade the premier institution of higher education in Eastern India. The end of the century also saw a rapid advance of education at all levels. During 1897-1902, the number of institutions had increased from 2800 to 3534 with a corresponding rise in number of pupils from 83,638 to 103,541. At the secondary stage, English education advanced more than vernacular which remained almost stationary during the period under review ; the number of students receiving English education in Assam rose from 7967 to 10,334. There was, above all, an upward trend in the number of successful candidates at the Entrance and other university examination as will be seen in the Appendix-B. As Principal Sudmersen remarks, "Assamese students have passed the F. A. Examinations in such large numbers and in such high divisions as were never dreamt of by the most sanguine Assamese leaders when the college was first started".6⁰ At no distant future, he fondly hoped, the

Assamese students will hold their own in public life, government and non-government, as their counterparts elsewhere in India. Sudmersen's expectations were not belied.
It will appear from the foregoing pages that the primary motive of the Assamese youths for English education was the prospect of better jobs under the government. This was not an exception in Assam or in any way unusual in that age or even in our own times. Robinson says: "The people of Bengal are actuated by no higher motive. I doubt whether even in enlightened England education is sought after for its own sake". This apart, English education and in its train western ideas brought about, though slowly, profound changes in every facet of Assamese life. Impact of the west was felt at first in Bengal, more correctly speaking in Calcutta, and its ripples before long flowed into the adjoining provinces. Of the early English educated youths imbibing western culture who sought to regenerate the Assamese the name of Anandaram Dhekial Phukan is pre-cminent.
Born at Gauhati in 1829 Anandaram was the son of Haliram Dhekial Phukan, the earliest apostle of modernism in Assam. A much travelled man as he was, Haliram keenly appreciated the significance of promoting cultural and commercial contact between the peoples of Assam and Bengal for the furtherance of which he contributed a series of articles in the Bengali periodicals of the age and also wrote a History of Assam on modern lines in Bengali which he is said to have distributed free of cost.62 His brother Jagnoram Phukan, the first English educated Assamese, was well versed in Sanskrit, Arabic, Persian, Urdu and Bengali. A member of Brahmo Samaj and disciple of Raja Rammohan Ray, Jagnoram had

liberal views on religion and society. A worthy son of his worthy father, Anandaram was the product of the Hindu College, the centre of the most advanced and liberal ideas of Bengal at the time. Young Anandaram was acquainted with Devendra Nath Tagore, David Hare and Raja Radha Kanta Deb. He had also relations with celebrities like Prasanna Kunar Tagore, Motilal Sil, Sitanath Ghosh and Ram Chandra Mitra. Ill Health and domestic worries compelled Anandaram to terminate his collegiate career shortly afterwards; yet he kept himself abreast with the progressive ideas of the day through the Bengali periodicals which he subscribed and through his intimate contact with several luminaries of Bengal.65
121
Anandaram was the true representative of the new age. His advanced and liberal views found clear expression in the representation which he made to Mills in the classic document Observation on the Administration of the Province of Assam. In his article Inglendar Vibaran in the Arunodai drawing a comparison with England he deplored the utter backwardness of the Indians although India attained the height of her civilisation much earlier than England. He traced the success of the English to their indomitable courage, spirit of independence and industrious habits. He made a fervent appeal to his countrymen to awake from their slumber and to emulate the Englishmen in their endeavours for the spread of knowledge and advancement in agriculture, industries and commerce. He was confident of their success provided they think not in terms of their own, but of the country as a whole.06 He revealed himself as the harbinger of the Modern age in the suggestions he made to Mills for all round improvement of the Assamese. In an agricultural country like Assam, he was well aware, the lot of the peasantry could not be

improved without the production of varied but marketable crops by improved methods of cultivation.67 He desired that the government should take the lead in bringing adequate number of agricultural experts from abroad to teach the people to raise varieties of valuable crops, improved methods of irrigation, drainage and embankments and every other means connected with agriculture. He wanted that every cultivator should be furnished with his requirement of machines, ploughs and harrows, improved breed of cattle and an adequate supply of seeds, plants, etc., both of Europe and Upper India. 68
Dhekial Phukan advocated importation of foreign technical know-how and foreign implements only at the initial stage but not indefinitely. He wanted the people to be selfreliant and to be entirely relieved of the necessity of relying on foreigners for their implements. He maintained; "No nation can secure to itself the blessings and comforts of civilized life until it has manufactures of it own No country can rise to wealth and importance that is deficient or imperfectly versed in manufactures". Hence he pleaded for the establishment of a number of technical schools to impart instructions in useful branches of European manufactures. The students should be taught in these schools to construct implements of agriculture and other works of utility, viz., silk and cotton cloths, utensils and other articles of daily use.69
...
An ardent advocate of western education, Dhekial Phukan laid stress on the necessity of raising the standard of the two existing English schools by the recruitment of adequate number of teachers duly qualified for the job. His was the first voice of protest against the imposition of Bengali as the medium of instruction in the schools and pleaded for its replacement by Assamese; the continuation of the foreign

medium, he was convinced, was the most fomidable bar in the progress of education of the Assamese pupils. He suggested in addition publication of a series of books on various subjects in Assamese, the establishment of a normal school for the training of teachers and the introduction of a mobile library of vernacular books for dissemination of information to the masses. In spite of the ravages of sickness and malignant diseases, Dhekial Phukan lamented, the people had little knowledge of medical science, but they had firm faith in incantations, charms and amulets. Orthodoxy of the age tabooed medical profession. To begin with he wanted that the people should be made familiar with the system of medicine developed by the Hindus in early times. At the same time, to confer on them the benefits of Western Medical Science, he suggested the establishment of district Medical Schools furnished with necessary books and appliances. When the people will realise the advantages of these institutions, he was confident, they will not only cooperate but prosecute medical studies as a profession.7⁰
123
Anandaram was the product of an age in which the conception of "Indian nationalism was yet in embryo"."¹ Till then as S. N. Sen writes "To the Punjabi the Hindustani was
a stranger, very few Bengalees realised that they belonged to the same nation as men from Maharastra and the people of central India and Rajputana did not acknowledge any bond of kinship with the people of south".72 Though Anandaram was not a nationalist in the modern sense of the term, he was intensely patriotic. His love for his country and countrymen found eloquent expression when he prays :
O' God the Gracious, lend such mind to the people of Assam by which they can make their country more civilized, learned and virtuous give them knowledge so that they may know their necessities and miseries; and by your wonderful power make them cultured and make them know you and make them fit to carry out your wishes.

He indeed dreamt of a noble dream
When Assam will be converted from a forest into a flower garden, the canoes of the rivers will be converted into ships, bamboo cottages will be replaced by buildings of stones and bricks; when there will be thousands and thousands of schools, educational gatherings, dispensaries, hospitals for the poor and the destitute; and when people, instead of entertaining jealousy will cherish love for on another, none will give false evidence for two tolas of opium and will rather throw aside lacs of rupees in such cases, when no one will do mischief to others being offered bribes of crores of rupees, prostitution, opium and wine will be unknown in the country, that time O' God the Almighty, father, bring about in no time.73
He was not destined to live long to see the fulfilment of his dream. His premature death at the age of about thirty in 1859 was a terrible blow to his countrymen at a crucial moment. Anandaram's ideas and idealisms, above all his intense patriotism, served as beacon light to the Assamesc youths for the next few generations.

<content>CHAPTER EIGHT
The Renaissance and Literature
The nineteenth century occupies a unique place in the history of India. It broke the "splendid isolation" which had hitherto "effectively shut up" the Indians from their contact with the western world. Spread of English education and infiltration through it of western ideas brought forth revolutionary changes in the outlook of the Indian-social, religious and political. Summarising the effects R. C. Majumdar writes:
There was a persistent demand for the removal of social abuses and introduction of social reforms on modern lines ... modern Indian literatures in the spoken languages in different localities had their birth. The periodical literature was an innovation with far-reaching consequences. The printing press made an, epoch-making change in the spread of education among the people. All these factors combined to generate among the Indians a strong sense of patriotism and nationalism which had transformed India from the Medieval to the Modern Age.¹
During the process of transition the English-educated youths were carried away in Assam, as elsewhere,* by the strong currents of western culture. They became anglicised and adopted not only western ideas but also dress, customs and manners. "It has been my practice" Hopkinson writes, "in receiving natives clad... after the European fashion, to regard them in that respect as Europeans and require them to keep their shoes
1 Majumdar, R. C. (ed.), The British Paramountey and Indian Renaissance, ii, Pp. 95-6.
* In Bengal, as Majumdar writes, "They became very much Anglicised and had inordinate fondness for everything English. They adopted western ideas and habits, dresses and mannerisms; customs and usages, and openly indicated their repugnance to everything Indian. They spoke in English, thought in English, and as humourously remarked by Bhudeb Mukherjee, probably even dreamed in English". Ibid, p. 465.

on". Since his return from Calcutta in 1845, Anandaram used trousers, hat and shoes whenever he visited Europeans or went out for a walk.³ Jagnoram Phukan went a step further. As reported by White, "He makes no objection to dine with Europeans and cats and drinks freely of what is put before him ... He procures a variety of wines and European delicacies from Calcutta and his house at Gauhati is amply furnished with chairs, tables, carpets, an organ, art glass lustres, and other articles of English furniture." Even an orthodox family like that of Dinanath Bezbarua, the father of Lakshminath Bezbaruah, the doyen of Assamese litterateurs, had to connive at the new hair-cut by his English-educated sous ignoring time honoured customs of keeping a pig-tail while Lakshininath frankly admitted in his autobiography that he dressed and behaved like a European. The silver lining was that in spite of westernisation they were not entirely allergic to indigenous customs and usages; and since their number was exceedingly small they could not form, as in Bengal or elsewhere, a distinct community of their own. Moreover, the changes were confined to a limited number of families in the urban areas while in the interior the common man continued to wrap himself with a piece of cloth over his shoulders and dhoti tied round his waist.

mosity against linguistic domination, the intelligentsia was not slow in adopting Bengali dress, customs, usages and even food habits. To counteract the evils of westernisation, this was welcomed even by the orthodox section of the community who felt proud to show their common heritage with their progressive neighbours. Assamese gentry were addressed as Babus and the latter evinced an increasing fascination for the punjabi, shawl and santipuri dhuti of Bengal. Assamese students studying in Calcutta adopted choga-chapkan while the ladies of the progressive families started wearing saris from Bengal abandoning their traditional costumes. Samachar Darpan, Samachar Chandrika and Masik Patrika had readers even in interior villages. The worship of the deities like Durga, Kali, Chandi, Annapurna, some of which were introduced even during the later part of the Ahom rule, became common not only in public but also in private residences occasionally in the accompaniment of jatras or dance-drama parties from Bengal. Musicians, drummers, dancers (baijees) began to add attraction to the festivals and marriage ceremonies of the well-to-do families. Even the gossains or the priests of some satras began to show a preference to foreign musical instruments in lieu of the indigenous ones. What was worse, there was evinced a sneering contempt amongst a section of the elite towards Bihu dance and songs, the traditional spring festival of the Assamese. ¹0

The impact of the west replaced the blind faith on agelong beliefs, customs and conventions by a spirit of rationalism.
This was one of the arguments put forward by Chandra Mohan Goswami, Member Asiatic Society Bengal, in his advocacy of retaining Bengali in schools and courts in Assam, AS., Assain Commissioner, File No, 471; see statement made by Babu Chandra Mohan Goswami.

THE RENAISSANCE AND LITERATURE
Orthodoxy continued to be the order of the day, but its rigidity gradually relaxed. Conservative Maniram bewailed: "By the reduction of all castes to the same level, the people are labouring under the deepest grief and mortification." The biographer of Anandaram mentions that while proceeding to Calcutta for higher education, Anandaram had not only to take the family deity (salagram sila) with him but even a Brahmin cook to prepare his meals in a foreign country. This was not repeated on his second visit to the Presidency since his stay at Metropolis had already changed his outlook. Assamese pupils of the orthodox families were seen studying side by side with the students of other (low caste) communities which was at one time considered highly objectionable.¹2 Learning of a foreign language or of going abroad were formerly social taboos. Even a social reformer like Hem Chandra Baruah had to study English without the knowledge of the members of his family." The outlook of the orthodox sections gradually changed and before the close of the century students from the high caste Hindus were seen proceeding to the Presidency for higher courses in English education.
The Assamese society was free from many of the social evils practised in Bengal. The kulinism, self immolation of the widows and infanticides were almost unknown while polygamy and child marriage did not reach alarming proportions as prevalent in Bengal or other parts of the country. Assamese women were held in the highest esteem in society, yet the education of women was sadly neglected. Though Assamese girls inherited from their mothers skill in spinning, weaving and domestic works, no provision was made, public or private, for their formal education. The daughters and wives of some enlightened and affluent families received lessons at home on rudiments of reading and writing, but the education of women

The first Missionary School was started at Sibsagar by Mrs. Brown and Mrs. Cutter in 1840; and this was followed up by the schools set up by Bronson at Nowgong (1843) and Mrs. Barker at Gauhati (1850)¹7. Reluctance of the high caste Hindus to send their daughters to Christian schools compelled the missionarics to depend on "bazar girls". Mrs. Brown says: "as heathen parents would not commit their children to the care of a Christian teacher, our pioneer missions went out into the highways and by-ways and sought the orphan and the homeless"." Payment of fees in these circumstances was ont of question ; the missionaries had to depend on the bounties of the few European settlers and mainly on resources of their own. In addition to reading and writing instructions were imparted in these institutions on sewing, knitting, spinning and domestic works. 19

Following Wood's Despatch of 1854, which laid stress on education of women, the first government primary school for girls was opened in 1860-1 at Sibsagar by its Deputy Inspector

Despite endeavours subsequently made by a number of liberal-minded Assamese and non-Assamese, the progress of female education was distressingly slow.21 In 1874-5, the total number of girls receiving primary education was 857 and this showed that out of every 10,000 females the percentage of literate stood at 4.33. Even in 1897-8, the number of primary schools for girls for the province including the hills was 235 with an enrolment of 3823 and the Middle schools 3 with 235 pupils. 22 That the public was not enthusiastic for the spread of female education is evident from the fact that at the close of the century although the number of private institutions for boys rose to 91 the number of similar institutions for girls was nil.23 Explaining the difficulties in the progress of female education, the Deputy Inspector of Schools, Nowgong reported:
skill in weaving, cooking and husking paddy, is considered greater accomplishments in a girl than all her knowledge in reading, writing and arithmetic. Besides, a girl is a great help to her mother attending to little babies, including other domestic works to this a servant is necessary to attend her to and from the school.24

tongue, touches lower part of his body and make queries not befitting her modesty so essential for a woman ? Western culture, higher education of women in particular, it was feared, would produce a greater disaster than the invasion of the Burmese in Assam. 26 In the absence of any propaganda or organised public opinion, misconceptions like these continued to persist till the carly decades of the present century when with the advance of western education and consequent widening of the mental outlook the education of women, including higher education, received due attention of the public at large.
131
About the same time, the problem of the Hindu widows attracted the attention of the educated Assamese. Even in the thirties of the nineteenth century, Jaduram Baruah, the first lexicographer in Assam, despite orthodoxy of the age is said to have not only advocated remarriage of the widows but married a widow himself.27 However, the greatest exponent was Gunabhiram Baruah, a close relative of Anandaram, and Hem Chandra Baruah, an eminent social reformer of the age. Educated at the Hindu (Presidency) College and later a Brahmo by faith, Gunabhiram was influenced by Iswar Chandra Vidyasagar, the greatest social reformer of Bengal, at whose instance the Government of India passed in 1856 Hindu Widows Re-marriage Act (Act XV of 1856). Gunabhiram is said to have had the chance of attending the first widow marriage celebrated at the Sookea Street, Calcutta, and was also present in two or three such ceremonies.28 His study of a number of Bengali dramas on the subject* might have prompted him to write the first modern drama Ram Navami Natak wherein he made the people to have a rethinking in encouraging perpetual widowhood. Considering that example is better than precept Gunabhiram married a widow, and his own daughter was

remarried after the death of her first husband. 29 In his Asamiya Bibaha Paddhati (Assamese Marriage System) Hem Chandra Baruah strongly advocated remarriage of the widows. He argued that if a woman was debarred from remarriage why would not the system be applicable to man also? "Not to speak of its sanction in the scriptures", he writes, in his autobiographical sketch,
one comes to reason
one can see that there is no harm in widow marriage even when The revered Vidyasagar did not keep quiet by simply proving that widow marriage is sanctioned by religious works of the Hindus, but he got his son married to a widow. He has drifted away in the current of age, but the footprints which he has left on the sands of time will remain for ever and never be lost. When will there be such a man in our country who will follow his footsteps? The echo resounds when ?30
...
But this remained unanswered. The remarriage of the widows made very little progress in Assam or elsewhere in India till our own time.
31
The reforming zeal of the intelligentsia extended to other evils in society. In an article Anek bia kara ajugut (It is wrong to marry many) in the Arunodai one "Sri Sonarchand" bitterly attacked the prevailing system of polygamy. The writer is believed to be no other than Hem Chandra Baruahı. The evils of too many marriages are reflected in Tini Ghaini (Three Wives) the dramatical work of a later writer Bendhar Rajkhowa. In his satire Bahire Rang-Chong Bhitare KoaBlaturi (externally pure, internally rotten) Hem Chandra exposed the vices of the Assamese society, particularly the irreligious acts of the priestly classes. The vicious lives led by the outsiders has been depicted in the Bangal-Bangalani Natak by Rudraram Bardoloi. Vices and superstitous belefs of the Assamese find mention in Lakshminath Bezbaruah's

Kripabar Baruar Kakatar Topola and Kripabar Baruar Obhotani.

Addiction to opium, which was eating into the very vitals of the Assamese society, did not escape criticism of the reformers. Referring to the dreadful effects of opium-cating Hemchandra in his Kaniyar Kirtan writes,
Kepa Kani Bihur Ses Kaniar Nai Gynar les
Hai Hai Ki Ghor kles
Kaniai Khale Asom Des
[There is
hardly any other more deadly poison than opium. The opium-caters are devoid of any wisdom. Alas Alas! What a terrible misery. Opium is at the root of the ruin of Assam. ]
32
Reference has already been made that the introduction of Government opium and gradual enhancement of its prices reduced opium-caters to pitcous misery. Though a loyal servant of the government, Anandaram commented on the opium policy of the government. He observed "The tree will grow so long as the root is not destroyed. The source must be completely exhausted and the introduction of fresh supplies (from) out of the country carefully suppressed". He was of course alive to the danger of a sudden and total abolition of the cultivation which will bring in loss of lives apart from untold sufferings to the opium-addicts. To cradicate the evil, he suggested to Mills total stoppage of government opium and restriction of the cultivation of poppy subjecting it to heavier assessment. Such a measure, he was hopeful, would make the article "less abundant and more scarce", compelling thereby the old "to be sparing in its use" and the young "less eager to become its pray". Appearing before the Royal Commission on Opium in 1891, Gunabhiram demanded its total abolition since the opium-eaters themselves felt, he

added, that the term Kania (opium-addict) was a byword of reproach.34 His views received support of Haribilas Agarwala, an enlightened opium-trader, who of course wanted the abolition by gradual doses lest it might create disturbances.³5 As the representative of the educated Assamese Satyanath Borah opined that the drug should be supplied only to those who cannot survive without its use. The Jorhat Sarbajanik Sabha headed by its President Jagannath Baruah opposed immediate and total abolition on the ground that such a measure would drive the opium-caters to the use of more harmful spirituous liquors." As a result of the conflicting views, the Royal Commission ended in nothing, but. it roused public consciousness which led to the emergence of Kani Nibarani Sabhas in several districts to combat the opium evil.37
36
Renaissance in Assamese literature was brought about by two forces the activities of the Christian missionaries, mainly the American Baptists, and the influence of renascent Bengal. Not unoften the cross followed the British armies; but in the North-East Frontier the process of evangelisation was rather slow. On the representation of Scott in 1829 a branch of the Scrampur Mission under James Rae, was set up at Gauhati; but the missionaries could not make much headway in their activities. In early 1835, with the object of pacifying the frontier tribes, particularly the Khamtis and the Singhphos, Jenkins invited the American Baptist Foreign Mission Society of Calcutta. The latter took the matter in right earnest and despatched a mission under Nathan Brown and Oliver Cutter with a printing press which arrived at Sadiya on 23 March 1836.3 They were followed by Miles Bronson, who commenced his work among the Nagas at Namsang near Jaypur.

Before long there also arrived A. H. Danforth, C. Barker, W. J. Ward, and A. K. Gurney. The uprisings of the Khamtis in 1839 forced Brown and his party to move to Sibsagar while on grounds of health Bronson, too, left the Nagas and settled at Nowgong where he baptised the first Assamese convert Nidhiram, later known as Nidhi Levi Farwell.39

Propagation of Christianity amongst the backward masses who were totally ignorant of English language compelled the missionaries to study the vernaculars and to translate the Bible. In licu of earlier verse they resorted to prose as the vehicle of information and expression. In addition to religious texts, they wrote grammar, dictionaries and useful books. Even before their arrival, with the aid of one Atmaram Sarmah of Kaliabar in the present district of Nowgong, the missionaries published an Assamese version of the Bible from the Serampur Press in 1813. In 1839 William Robinson published the Grammar of Assamese Language. Bronson, Brown and Nidhi Levi, the trio, laid the foundation of the modern Assamese language. Bronson's monumental work Dictionary in Assamese and English was published from the Serampur Press in 1867, the earliest of its kind till 1900. Prior to it Jaduram Baruah compiled an Assamese-Bengali Dictionary, but it remained unpublished.* Brown published his Grammatical Notice of the Assamese Language (1848), translated portions of the New Testament (1850)-Mark, Matthew, Luke, and John and collected a lot of Assamese manuscripts. For the use of Assamese pupils Mrs. Brown, too, wrote a story book, an arithmetic and a geography. A regular contributor to the Arunodai Nidhi Levi is credited with the translation of the Bharatiya Dandabidhi Ain and Natural Science in Familiar Dialogue from Bengali (1855). "These general treatise

science by Farwell together with other scientific tracts of the missionaries laid the foundation of scientific vocables and synonyms together with a flexible prose style for scientific expression. 10 But the crowning achievement of the missionaries was the publication of the Arunodai, the first Assamese monthly, devoted "to religion, science and general intelligence". First published in January 1846 and continued with occasional breaks until 1882, Arunodai disseminated western thought and learning, inspired the younger generation of the Assamese and paved the way for an intellectual awakening.
Of the contributions made by other Christian writers, mention may be made of S. R. Ward's Anglo-Assamese Vocabulary (1864), H.B.L. Cutter's Anglo-Assamese Phrases (1877), A. K. Gurney's Kaminikanta (1877) and Mrs. Gurney's Fulmati Aru Karuna Kanta (1877). For the spread of education they wrote Barc-Matara, Pratham Kitap, Padartha Vidya, Pratham Ganana, Dwitiya Ganana and story books like Afrikar Konwar, Mauri Caoli, Egalar Bah, Dharmik Chaha, Rebir Kahini, Ramgotir Kahini and several others. ¹1
The Missionaries had thus contributions both in religious and secular subjects; but most of the works being translations, they "lacked originality" and were "artificial" and even "amusing for their perpetration of malapropisms".4² Nonetheless, they enriched Assamese literature by reintroducing words which were out of use and even coining simpler and indigenous words. They brought about the renaissance in Assamese literature by opening the door to the west. The medieval outlook with emphasis on spiritual and supernatural themes was replaced by secular subjects and rational outlook and in its train there came western literary forms-lyrics, dramas, sonnets, novels, short stories and biographies. The Missionari "not only liberated the spirit of the Assamese from the bondage of

Hemchandra, Gunabhiram and Anandaram, "The Trinity" laid the foundation of modern Assamese language and literature ou a solid basis. Like Raja Rammohan Ray, Hemchandra Baruah (1835-96) occupics a unique place in the evolution of Assamese prose literature. Besides his literary works on the removal of the abuses in Assamese society, he wrote for the Assamese pupils-Adipath and Pathmala at a time when textbooks were the crying need of the hour*. He has been rightly called the father of the modern Assamesc language and literature for his two monumental works-the Grammar of the Assamese language (1856) and Hem-Kos (1900), the earliest standard Anglo-Assamese Dictionary, containing etymology and meaning of over 22,000 words. Gunabhiram Baruah (1835-97) heralded the dawn of the new era by the publication of (i) the Assam Buranjit (1884), the earliest comprehensive history of Assam on modern lines, both objective and analytical (ii) the first Assamese modern drama Ram Navami Natak (1857) (iii) the first Assamese biography Anandaram Dhekial Phukanar Jiban Charitra (1880) and (iv) the first Assamese journal the Assam Bandhu. In the hands of Gunabhiram Assamese prose instead of being "an instrument for proselytisation"¹ reached its perfection while English style and syntax is evident in the writings of Anandaram Dhekial Phukan (1821-59). The publication of the Assamese Lorar Mitra in two parts (1859) by Anandaram

*He was awarded a reward of Rs. 1100 by the government for these text-books in addition to the translation of Way to Health into Assamese Asamiya Svasthar Niam. He showed his ability as an editor of the Anglo-Assamese weekly the Assam News (1882) which though lasted for three years continued to be a source of inspiration to his
successors.
In the periodicals of the age Gunabhiram contributed a number of illuminating historical articles-Assam-Atit aru Vartaman (Assain-its past and present-Assam Bandhu) Saumar Bhraman (Travel of Upper Assam-Jonaki), Asamat Manor Sehchoa (Last days of the Burmese in Assam-Jonaki) and Alikhit Buranji (Unwritten History-Jonaki).

dispelled the belief that the Assamese people were incapable of writing reading materials for the schools.
Reference has already been made to the strong plea made by Anandaram in his Observation on the Administration of the Province of Assam for the reinstatement of the Assamese in place of Bengali in courts and schools of Assam. "We made a great mistake” candidly admitted Mills "in directing that all business should be transacted in Bengalee, and that Assamese must acquire it".45 Since it was too late to retrace it, he recommended the suggestions made by Anandaram to the Council of Education for its consideration. Whatever their ulterior objectives, strongest support came from the Christian missionaries. Not only did they join hands with Anandaram and others in urging the government to place Assamese in its rightful place as the language of the courts and schools in Assam, but prepared the ground for it by the production of a number of works in Assamese, both original and translated on diverse subjects. To strengthen the belief in the universal use and ancient nature of language, Bronson remarked :
RENAISSANCE
Assamese is the language usually spoken by the entire population of the Brahmaputra Valley, and in most cases it is the only medium of intercourse with the bordering hill tribes. There is nothing to show that Assamese race and their language have not existed in the valley from time immemorial; and it is surprising that during the change of rulers, the oppression and misrule in which they have been subjected, there are no trace of any material change in their language.4
46
Reminding the injurious effect of the use of Bengali in education A. H. Danforth wrote:
...
The boys are set to learning Bengalee; they spend a year or two in running over, parrot-like, unmeaning words and sentences, without the slightest idea of what they read how could we expect there should be either interest in education or advancement in study this feature of education policy (is) destructive of the highest motive of education, and must necessarily cripple the

advancement of the schools, as well as separate them from the sympathies of the people.17
139
Notwithstanding these observations the authorities in Calcutta remained unconcerned to this vital issue under the impression that "Assamese was only patois of the Bengalee language and had no literature of its own". This was forcefully refuted by "a Native" who was no other than Anandaram in a pamphlet, A Few Remarks on the Assamese Language published in 1855 at the Baptist Mission Press, Sibsagar. Exhibiting thercin his mastery over English, Bengali, Hindi and Assamese, Dhekial Phukan pointed out that out of 287 words in an Assamese passage, 112 were entirely different from Bengali, 98 derived from Sanskrit and only 77 had some resemblance with the Bengali Language. The appendix at the end containing a list of Assamese Literature of sixty two religious and over forty dramatic works proved beyond doubt that Assamese had a literature of their own." 48
Convinced of the separate identity and growing standard of Assamese language, Colonel J. C. Haughton, the officiating Commissioner, recommended that Assamese should be made the language of the courts. This was not acceptable to the government of Bengal although civil officers serving in Assam were required, hereafter, to pass in Assamese as their counterparts in Bengal were to pass in Bengali.49 Apprehending this to be the first step in the process of Assamisation, the opposition mustered strong and endeavoured to thwart it by all possible arguments. It was represented that the European functionaries had no alternative but to make Bengali the court language since there were too many dialects current in Assam; that Bengali was intelligible to the masses; that the gentry of Assam were descendants of persons who migrated from Bengal

Sankar Dev, Madhav Dev, Rameswar Sharma and others earliest writers in the Assamese language must have been either Bengalees, and therefore they must have written in the language of their own country, their books by frequent transcription have lost their original peculiarities and have been modified to the peculiarities of Assamese dialects.50
Reference has already been made to the circumstances that led to the adoption of the language of the courts in Assam*. There is every reason to believe that a section of the Assamese might have migrated from Upper India or even from Bengal, but the contention that early litterateurs and reformers of Assain hailed from Bengal is entirely baseless. Admitting that the gentry of Assam were emigrants from Bengal, there is hardly any justification in imposing their language on the majority against their wishes. The argument that Bengali was understood by all section of the Assamese people was also false. In fact the language that was used in courts and schools in Assam was not Bengali, but
a mongrel language, a spurious compound of Bengalee, Assamese and Urdu—which no Assamese can speak or understand and which even a Bengalce, it fresh from his own country would require time to master.
Yet this was taught in indigenous schools, not because, as a contemporary official expressed,
puplis will ever talk in Bengali; but because it is the language of the courts and offices, and a smattering of it therefore a "sine qua non" for all who hope one day to obtain employment under Government.52
The arguments put forward by the pro-Bengal elements

<content>Assamese-Language of the Court and Schools
mese headed by Bronson on 9 March 1872.53 Sir George Campbell, the Lieutenant Governor, was told that the authorities in Calcutta had so far failed to do justice to the Assamese mainly because their ignorance of the Assamese or Bengali language had made them to rely on their Bengali subordinates -persons naturally averse to introduction of Assamese in the courts and schools in Assam. The memorialists never failed to convince the Lieutenant Governor that the demands made by the Assamese were reasonable; that "Assamese was still the vernacular of the people", "it is taught in Missionary school", and that "there are books and Dictionary published in the Assamese language". Since the general policy of the Government of India was the adoption of vernacular in the courts, Campbell argued, there could hardly be any valid reason against the introduction of the Assamese in the courts. Before arriving at a final decision on the subject, he called upon the Commissioner of Assam to give his views on the subject in consultation with the Deputy Commissioners of the district.53
141
In his reply, Henry Hopkinson, the Commsioner of Assam, was decidedly in favour of the retention of Bengali and so also were the views of those officers who were in the province for a short time, but the Deputy Commissioners who had practical experience, almost all of them pleaded for substitution of Assamese for Bengali. Unhesitatingly, George Campbell decided on 9 April 1873 that Assamese be introduced in the courts and schools in the valley of the Brahmaputra subject to the condition that "when a class of twelve or more boys wish for it, Bengalce may be separately taught them as a language". To meet the difficulties arising out of the paucity of text books,, particularly in the upper classes of higher schools, provision was made that "every subject in which where there is an Assamese book is to be taught in Assamese; subjects in which Assamese school books

Thus the controversy over the language was over and the victory was on the side of the Assamese elite. But to follow up the successes demanded rejuvenation and strengthening of the Assamese language and literature by the production of literary works particularly reading materials for the pupils at different levels in schools. The task posed to be a formidable one for the number of Assamese litterateurs and even the educated could be counted on fingers. This was borne out by the fact that only a limited number of Assamese authors competed for prizes in text-books declared by the government and even those submitted barring two were found unsuitable.56 Even in 1881, as reported by J. Wilson, the Inspector of Schools, the position remained more or less the same.57 At one stage, the Commissioner of Assam requested the Lieutenant Governor of Bengal to give a second thought over the whole issue with the remark "it will be a priceless boon to the cause of education in Assam if you could prevail upon the Government to reinstate Bengalee as the proper medium of inscription for our Assamese schools".58
To the English-educated Assamese it was indeed a big challenge, but they rose up to the occasion. The establishment of the Asamiya Bhasa Unnati Sadhini Sabha or Assamese Language Improving Society on 25 August 1888 by a few Assamese students in Calcutta is a landmark in the history of Assamese language and literature. Amongst its earlier members, mention may be made of Ramakanta Barkakoti, Chandra Kumar Agarwala, Lakshminath Bezbaruah, Ananda Chandra Gupta, Kanaklal Baruah, IIemchandra Goswami, Padmanath Gohain Baruah, Upendra Nath Baruah and

To carry out its activities effectively branches of the society were set up at Kohima, Dibrugarh, Sibsagar, Nowgong, Tezpur, Barpeta, Jorhat, North Lakhimpur and Gauhati, although the headquarters continued to be located at Calcutta. By 1893 the membership of the Society rose to 123. It had brought out a comprehensive list of Assamese books (1895), edited Lora Sikshsa II by Panindra Nath Gogoi, translated Longfellow's "Psalm of Life" and collected funds for the publication of Hemchandra Baruah's Anglo-Assamese Dictionary. The emergence of the Jonaki in February 1889, an Assamese monthly, as the unofficial mouthpiece of the Society ushered in a new cra in Assamese literature. As Dimbeswar Neog says: "The Orunodai and the Jonaki were practically the organs of the two movements, the former against the usurpation by the Bengali (language) and the latter for the recoronation of the Assamese after her restoration".62

Edited successively by Chandra Kumar Agarwala, Hem Chandra Goswami and Lakshminath Bezbaruah, like the Bangadarshan, the Jonaki became the forum of a group of eminent writers who were instrumental in bringing about a renaissance in Assamese literature in the closing years of the nineteenth

century. They were inspired to a great extent by their counterparts in Bengal-Biharilal Chakravarty, Hemchandra Chattopadhyaya, Nabin Chandra Sen, Madhusudan Datta and Bankim Chandra Chattopadhyaya-who were in turn influenced by English literature "in their approach and attitude, subject and content, and also style and diction".64 Western literature brought in its train romanticism then revived in England by Wordsworth, Coleridge, Byron, Shelley and others. The new wave of romanticism emphasised amongst others love of nature, romantic love, adoration of beauty, humanism, sympathy for the common place, glorification of the past, patriotism and love of the country. Renaissance in Assamese literature which had its beginning with the American Baptists reached its culmination in the Jonaki Age.
Impact of the west resulted in the growth of lyric poetry in Assamese literature*. Bholanath Das (1858-1919) in his pocms Megh and Kiyano Najage Amar Man brings in "the message of the TCW age". The influence of Michael Madhusudan's use of blank verse is apparent in his Sita-IIaran Kavya as well as in his contemporary Ramakanta Choudhury's (1846-89) Abhimanyu Badha Kavya. The florescence of the Assamese romanticism actually began with Chandra Kumar Agarwala (1867-1938), the founder-editor of the Jonaki. In his two collections of poetical works Pratima and Bin Baragi, the salient features of romanticism are clearly noticeable-love of nature (Niyar, Ban-Kunwari, Jal Kunwari), adoration of beauty (Sundar, Saundarya), humanism (Manav-Bandana, Biswa Bhawariya), revolutionary spirit (Bin-Baragi) and love for the poor and downtrodden (Tezimala). But the outstanding literary figure of the Jonaki Age was Lakshminath Bezbaruah (18681938). Born and brought up in an orthodox Brahmin family of Upper Assam, Lakshminath had his higher education at the

Hindu College at a time when under the influence of English education a literary revolution was in progress in Bengal. A poet, journalist, essayist, dramatist, and humourist, Lakshminath is acknowledged as the uncrowned king of Assamese literature. He was at his best as a writer of ballads, nature-poems and love-lyrics. Evidence of Assamese romanticism is seen in his poems in Kadamkali while he reveals himself as a patriot in some of his songs and poems. Another literary stalwart of the age was Hemchandra Goswami (1872-1928) whose PriyatamarChithi (A letter from the Beloved) is the carlicst sounet written on the models of Milton, Shakespeare and Petrarch. Mention may be made of two other sonneteers-Hiteswar Barbaruah (1876-1939) (Malach, Chakula) aud Durgeswar Sarmah (18851961) (Anjali, Nihedan). Barbaruah showed his literary genius as a writer of Assamese Kavyas in blank verse. Though he modelled his works after Michael Madhusudan and Nabin Chandra Sen he chose his themes from the historical anecdotes of Assam. Of these mention may be made of Kamatapur Dhvamsa Kavya (1912), Birahini Bilap Karya (1912), Tirotar Atmadan Kavya (1913), Juddha Kshetrat Ahom Ramani Kavya (1915).
Modern Assamese drama had its beginning, as mentioned already, with Gunabhiram's Ram Navami Natak, Hemchandra Baruah's Kaniyar Kirtan and Rudraram Bardoloi's BangalBangalani Natak. Introduction of acts and scenes, asides, soliloquies and blank verse are some of the techniques in modern dramas. Under inspiration of Shakespearcan dramas Assamese playwrights directed their attention to tragedies. In 1880, Assamese rendering of Shakespeare's Comedy of Errors, Bhramaranga, was made by the Assamese residents in Calcutta. Bezbaruah admitted that he had modelled some of the characters in his Chakradhwaj Singha (Priyaram, Gajpuria), after Henry IV (Prince Hall, Falstaff).65 Likewise, influence of

THE RENAISSANCE AND LITERATURE
Othello is evident in Benudhar Rajkhowa's Seuti-Kiran (1894). Influence of Michael Madhusudan is again discernible in Chandradhar Baruah's (1874-1961) two dramas in blank verseMeghnad-Badh (1904) and (1904) and Tilottama-Sambhava (1926). Benudhar Rajkhowa's Kuri Satikar Sabhyata (1908) attacked halfeducated westernised youths while Tini Ghaini (1928), Asikshita Ghaini (1912) and Topanir Parinam (1932) sought to eradicate the evils of the Assamese society. Social life of the Assamese middle class employees in the European tea-gardens has been brilliantly portrayed in Durga Prasad Majindar Baruah's farcical drama Mahari (1896). Padmanath Gohain Baruah (18711946) has to his credit as many as eight dramas, both historical and farcical; of these Gaonburah (1897), like Dinabandhu Mitra's Nila-Darpan, depicts the corrupt practices of the underlings of the British government in the closing years of the nineteenth century.
Impact of the west brought in its wake new literary forms in prose literaturc-novels, cssays and short stories. A. K. Gurney's Kaminikanta (1877), though scriptural in tone, may be regarded as the first modern Assamese novel. Mrs. Gurney's Phulmani Aru Karuna is merely a translation of a Bengali novel of the same title. Religious overtone which mar the social content of these Christian writers' novels was absent in Sudharmar Upakhyan (1880) of Padmavati Devi Phukanani, the daughter of Anandaram Dhekial Phukan. Full-fledged modern novel emerged with Padmanath Gohain Baruah's Bhanumati (1891) and Lahori (1892). Under the inspiration of Sir Walter Scott, like Bankim Chandra, Rajani Kanta Bardoloi (1867-1939) wrote a series of historical novels-Monomati (1900), Dandua Droh (1925), Nirmal Bhakat (1926) and Rahdoi-Ligiri (1930) depicting the political and social life of the Assamese during the period of civil strife and Burmese invasions of Assam. Bardoloi's work, B. K. Baruah remarks, "endures for its depth of Philosophic comment, descriptive power, fidelity to life. creative imagination and charm of style".

<content>Renaissance in Assamese Literature
As a writer of the Assamese prose Lakshminath Bezbaruah is unrivalled. Like Bankim Chandra, he was both "a pathfinder and a path-maker". The series of essays he wrote on diverse subjects under the caption-Kripabar Baruar Kakatar Topola (1904) and Kripabar Baruar Obhotani (1909) are masterpieces in Assamese satire. Satyanath Borah (1860-1925) has a style of his own marked by originality in thought, "directness, epigrammatic brevity and concentrated wisdom of aphorisms".67 Padmanath Gohain Baruah showed his excellence as a prose writer in his Shri Krishna. Invaluable contributions had been made by Gohain Baruah, Panindra Nath Gogoi and several others for the spread of education by writing textbooks for Assamese pupils. An antiquarian to his core, Hemchandra Goswami's solid contribution was his compilation Typical Selections from Assamese Literature in several volumes. Another forceful writer of the age was Kamalakanta Bhattacharya (1853-1936) whose essays like Gutidiyek Chintar Dhau raised a voice of protest against social inequalitics, priestly domination, caste system and antiquated customs, institutions and usages of the day.
Modern short story which differs from old-tales and myths both in style and structure had its birth in the Jonaki Age and herein, too, Bezbaruah was the pioneer. In his Sadhu Kathar Kuki (1910), Suravi (1912) and Jonbiri (1913), he has masterfully portrayed the social life of the Assamese middle class and the peasantry-their joys and sorrows, hopes and fears and strength and weaknesses. Sarat Chandra Goswami has also showed his talent as a short story writer in his Galpanjali (1914) and Mayna (1920). Of the other writers in this field, mention may be made of Lakshmi Nath Phukan (Mala-1918), Nakul Chandra Bhuyan (Chorang Chowar Chora-1918) and Dandinath Kalita (Sadhana-1930).
Western romanticism stimulated patriotic ardour and the spirit of revivalism in Assamese literature both in poctry and

stage of the past by the collection and publication of materials, literary or otherwise, lying scattered and uncared for indifferent parts of the province. The process started with Nathan Brown was followed up by Haribilas Agarwala, Kaliram Baruah, Sibanath Bhattacharya, Hemchandra Goswami, Kaliram Medhi and several others. Through the pages of Assam Bandhu, Jonaki, Bijuli, Banhi, Alochani, Gunabhiram Baruah, Ratneswar Mahanta, Rajani Kumar Padmapati, Kanaklal Baruah, Sonaram Choudhury threw light on aspects of the history and culture of Assam. Hemchandra Goswami's collection of over two hundred manuscripts, both Sanskrit and Assamese, and his publication of the Purani Assam Buranji, Darrang Raj Vansavali and particularly A Descriptive Catalogue of the Assamese Manuscripts in several volumes laid the foundation of Assamese history on a firm basis. E.A. Gait's claim as the father of the History of Assam, by and large, rests on collections made by late Goswami. The subsequent establishment of the Kamarupa Anusandhan Samiti and editing and publication of a series of Assamese chronicles by S. K. Bhuyan, both in Assamese and English, has created increasing interest in Assam's history and civilization amongst scholars in India and abroad.
THE RENAISSANCE AND LITERATURE
Kamalakanta Bhattacharya was the literary prophet of patriotism and nationalism. One would find in his poems glorification of the past, rebellion against social evils and vindication of national honour. His intense patriotism which was "burning within himself" found eloquent expression in his poetical works Chintanal (1890) and Chintatarangini (1933). In his poem Paharani (Forgetfulness), in order to rouse the dormant spirit of his countrymen he reminds them of their glorious past which was then in oblivion. Like Dayananda Saraswati, he believed that Aryans were the torch-bearers of world civilization and that at one time the land of Aryabarta, the home of Aryans, was the centre of world civilisation. He was hopeful of a bright future and that day will arrive when there Will be born hundreds of Mazzinis From out of neglected stones

In his poetical works Ambikagiri Ray Choudhury (1885-1967) not only emerges as a fighter for country's freedom but a crusader against social inequalitics, oppression, exploitation, meanness, selfishness that pervaded the social life of the Assamese. He unfurls the standard of revolt in his poem Moi Viplavi Moi Tandavi (1 aîn a rebel, I am a Nihilist). His Satadhar, a revolutionary booklet, was banned soon after a few copies of it were circulated while his drammatical work Bandini Bharat was seized by the Police before it was sent to the press. In his Agnimantra, Prasannalal Choudhury, a later writer, carries forward revolution and in the words of Hem Baruah, an eminent litterateur, "enlivens the dying embers of A. G. Ray Choudhury with a passion. The spirit of revivalism was echoed and re-echoed in the poems of Binanda Chandra Baruah (Sankhadhvani) Jyoti Prasad Agarwala (Bharat-Janamabhumi, Uddudhan) Atul Hazarika (Devi ne Rakshashi) and a few others.

The Press And Political Associations
The growth and development of the press or journalism in Assam was the outcome of the introduction of printing press in the province in the forties of the nineteenth century. The Arunodai, the first Assamese monthly, was published, as mentioned already, from the American Baptist Mission Press at Sibsagar in 1846. Prior to it accounts of the events of Assam appeared mostly in newspapers of Bengal. In the beginning Indian and non-Indian residents of Assam used to send letters to the editors of newspapers and periodicals in Calcutta which in addition to their individual opinion ou a particular issuc contained useful information with regard to the developments in the province. The editors in their turn took great interest in publishing their letters and often added personal remarks in the form of small notes. The Friend of India in its issue of 22 March 1838 in addition to correspondents' own observations threw a flood of light on the annexation of Upper Assam and on the rule of Raja Purandar Singha. Similar news and observations had been published even in vernacular papers like Samachar Darpan, Samachar Chandrika and Sanjibani.
For fear of incurring displeasure of the government the Arunodai, hardly published anything offensive to the government even on matters affecting the interests of the ryots. Its tone was generally religious and sectarian. The newspapers like the Dacca News and the Somprakash nevertheless continued to draw attention of the government through their columns to matters relating to public interests in Assam. In

trative changes in Assam to develop her vast untapped resources.¹ The paper commented on the new rules limiting right of appeal of the common man to higher courts in certain Civil Suits and suggested that in a Non-regulated province like Assam the judges and pleaders be appointed only after their passing qualifying examinations. It protested against frequent re-assessment which compelled the ryots to migrate to areas where revenue was lower making difficult thereby for the mouzadars the collection of revenue.²

The closing years of the nineteenth century may be regarded as the formative period of Assamese journalism. During this period, as recorded in a note submitted by Hem Chandra Goswami to the Department of Ethnography in Assam, there appeared and disappeared, over a dozen of newspapers and periodicals in different parts of the province. Of these The Assam Bilashini, published in 1871 from the Dharmaprakash Press, Auniati Satra, district of Sibsagar, though devoted to religious matters contained useful knowledge and information. The weekly Assam Mihir (1872) and Assam Darpan (1874) went out of circulation within a year or so after publication. Similar was the fate of the Goalpara Hitasadhini in Bengali, Chandrodoy and Assam Dipika. The Anglo-Assamese weekly Assam News (1882) published from Gauhati under the able editorship of Hem Chandra Baruah raised the standard of journalism in Assam by circulating not only useful knowledge and information but also discussing problems of common interest with the object of creating public opinion. Likewise the Mau or The Bee (1886), though

4 With respect to the tone of this paper, the Commissioner of Assam remarked in the Administrative Report of 1883-4: "This newspaper no doubt represents the views at any rate of its conductors, contributors and subscribers Its tone contrasts, I think, favourably with the native press of Lower Bengal.

short-lived, held advanced and progressive views on burning topics of the day. It opined that the existing system of nomination in the Local Boards had made these bodies a part of the bureaucracy, and that the system of nomination should be replaced by election to train up the people in the art of representative government. It commented severely the slavish mentality of the educated youths for their hankering after white-collared jobs and condemned the anti-Bengali feeling that was then rife in the Assam Valley and strongly felt that the interest of the country demanded unity and amity irrespective of the caste, creed and community.5
The Assam Bandhu edited by Gunabhiram Baruah appeared in 1885 as a monthly journal from Nowgong. Disseminating scientific and useful information, the journal aimed at widening the mental outlook of the Assamese then moving in a narrow groove. "We don't want to interfere in politics" said the editor, because "we are inexperienced in it". In a similar tone Chandra Kumar Agarwala, the editor of the Jonaki (1889), explained the object of his journal; "politics is outside our purview. In a dependent state social welfare is more important". Though non-political in character, by bringing about a literary awakening, these journals indirectly contributed in rousing the national consciousness of the Assamese. With the growth of public opinion, political and national problems attracted the attention of the Assamese editors. Padmanath Gohain Baruah, the forceful editor of the Bijuli (1891), in a series of articles entitled 'Political articles' emphasised the significant rôle to be played by the newspaper as the connecting link between the government and the governed. In his view
recent criminal cases in the Sibsagar district in which the Europeans were concerned, I find, nothing in this newspaper calculated to foster ill-feeling between the natives and the Europeans".

for fear of offending the government, not to speak of government servants, even civilians never write anything on political affairs.

The Assam, an Assamese Weekly, published from Gauhati in 1894 was "national in tone";" but it was The Advocate of Assam (1904-7), edited by Mathuramohan Baruah, that actually stood for nationalism, Swadeshi and Swaraj. So also was the Assam Bilashini edited by Krishna Kanta Bhattacharya which appeared in 1914, but ceased to exist following repressive measures of the government in the wake of the Non-cooperation movement. The case was otherwise with Assam Banti (1900) and the planter's mouthpiece the Times of Assam (1895); both of these weeklies were moderate in tone. Under the able leadership of Radhanath Changkakoti and his successors for over half a century The Times of Assam rendered yeoman's service to the growth of public opinion in Assam.
In the eighties there existed three papers in the Surma Valley The Paridarsak, a Bengali fortnightly and later (1886) weekly, The Srihatta Mihir (1889) and The Silchar (1886). Moderate in tone, these papers were more of "a local intelligence than a political publication" circulating local news and cuttings from Calcutta papers.10 The Srihattabasi which appeared in 1893 amalgamated next year with the Paridarsak and became Paridarsak-o-Srihattabasi but discontinued its publication in 1898. In 1900 Paridarsak was revived, and there also appeared the Srihatta. Darpan and the Weekly Chronicle. The latter had the same influence in the districts of Cachar and Sylhet as the Times of Assam in the Assam Valley. The extremist organs the Deshabarta and the Praja-Sakti published during the period of partition agitation

from Sylhet were "notorious for their scurrilous tone".11 The Deshabarta was not only warned but made to pay a security for publishing a letter denouncing the administration of police in the district of Sylhet.¹2
THE PRESS AND POLITICAL ASSOCIATIONS
The Assamese Press, whether English or vernacular, though in general moderate in tone never failed in making comments on acts of governments adversely affecting the interest of the masses. The Advocate of Assam published from time to time articles even condemning the policy of the government as "unsympathetic and retrograde".13 The paper strongly denounced the existing land laws of Assam since they denied the cultivators permanent rights over lands. "The ryot", explained the paper, "cannot now look upon his land as something which he permanently owns; he feels no abiding interest in it and cares not to improve it to the extent he would have otherwise done."¹4 Even The Times of Assam traced the poverty and degraded condition of the Assamese ryots to their being debarred from participation in the benefits of the permanent settlement and urged remedial measures at the earliest opportunity.¹5 Suggestions were often made by Assam papers that the electorates of the Local Boards in Assam should be composed of men who possessed some educational qualifications and not by the gaonburahs who were, according to The Times of Assam, "Creatures of the Mouzadars and had hardly any pretension of education".16 The Assamese Press never ceased to protest against the employment of non-Assamese in educational services and demanded Assamese headmasters for Assamese schools and lost no opportunity in pointing out the successes of schools under Assamese management.

<content>Assamese Press: Its Observations
Assamese members of the Legislative Council were not above the criticism of the local Press. A Sibsagar correspondent of the The Times of Assam in its issue of 24 June 1911 disparagingly remarked that they were not fulfilling the trust entrusted to them inasmuch as they had concentrated their attention exclusively on the welfare of Kamrup and Nowgong.17
155
The Assamese Press directed its attention not merely to local needs and requirements, but took interest in national and international affairs. Welcoming Morley-Minto reforms, The Times of Assam with its pro-government leanings remarked: "if the reforms will not be able to reconcile the irreconcilables, we do not know what will. In that case the fault will not lie with the government".18 With reference to the Turko-Italian War (1911-12) the same paper doubted whether it would be possible for the Muslims of the British dominion to maintain its strict neutrality since the Sultan of Turkey was their recognised Caliph. The position of the Indians in the colonies also excited criticism in the local press. The Times of Assam held the view that "treatment befitting helots was meted out to the Indians in the colonics" specially in Canada and British Columbia, and therefore it pleaded for intervention by the Government of India."

With the spread of western ideas the need was gradually felt for the formation of political associations and oganisations to ventilate the grievances of the people. It was believed that only by constitutional agitation on western lines through prayers, petitions, memorials, public meetings, ctc., that the aspirations of the people could be brought to the notice of the government and that it was only by such means that political consciousness of the people could be roused. Anandaram Dhekial Phukan may be regarded as the pioneer in starting political agitation in Assam. In his Observations on the

Administration of the Province of Assam, not only did he bring home to the government the shortcomings in different aspects of British administration but also made constructive suggestions for their improvement. Protesting against the system of short term settlements, he pleaded for the creation of a class of revenue collectors having lasting interests subject to the restrictions necessary to guard against their abuse. This did not mean that he was in favour of the zamindari system as it existed in Bengal which was highly injurious to the welfare and happiness of nearly the whole population". Likewise he opposed the idea of disposal of ryots' lands with Collectors on long leases fearing that, that would place the former at the tender mercies of the Collector, subverting gradually their existing rights and privileges. He advocated instead the prcservation of the ryotwari system which recognised the ryots as proprietors of their respective holdings.22 Dhekial Phukan never failed to draw the attention of the government to the pressure of revenue on the ryots which was fixed without any reference to the quality of the land or capabilities of the ryots. Enhancement of revenue without any improvement in agriculture or commerce, he maintained, was at the root of the miseries of the people.23 Couched in moderate language, Dhekial Phukan's Observations virtually condemned the prevailing system of administration of justice. From one corner of the province to another, he asserted, the people would declare that
the public courts of justice are exclusively for the benefit of the rich and the powerful, that it is both imprudent and foolish for men of humble life to resort to them for relief, that cunning and deceit, falsehood and perjury beset the courts on all sides and that in the civil and criminal courts, truth is often transformed into falsehood and falsehood into truth.24

This universal complaint, he attributed to the "inefficiency of the police", "paucity of (law) courts", "their distance from the interior of a district", "defective, tedious, dilatory, expensive nature of law and procedure" and above all to the "universal corruption" which prevailed amongst the ministerial officers. By way of remedial measures he suggested inter alia, multiplication in the number of moffusil courts, appointment of vakeels and duly qualified judges, effective supervision and control over law courts, improvements in law and procedure in the courts.25
157
The earliest organised effort to express public opinion in Assam appears to have been made on 11 June 1852 when a representation was made by the inhabitants of Gauhati to the Deputy Commissioner, Kamrup, praying for the introduction of Municipal Administration under provision of the Act XXVI of 1850.26 The petition was turned down by the Commissioner of Assam on the ground that in the absence of independent citizens of rank and fortune to enforce the Act, there was every likelihood of concentration of excessive power in the hands of the magistrates. When however it was found that there was no objection to the measure from any other quarter the Government of Bengal yielded to the public demand and accordingly the Act was introduced with effect from 1852. Mention has already been made that in 1862 when the Lieutenant Governor paid a visit to Assam, the educated Assamese prayed for the establishment of a high school or college for higher education in Assam. 27
In the meantime there had emerged several associations and organisations, mostly of cultural and literary character, which provided meeting places for exchange of views and for the promotion of common objectives. Since most of these

associations were shortlived, information as to their organisation and workings are extremely meagre. In 1885, through the endeavours of Priyalal Baruah, the Deputy Inspector of Schools, a literary association, the Assam Desh Hitaishini Sabha was formed at Sibsagar and the next year it issued a circular urging the people to represent their grievances to the Lieutenant Governor of Bengal.28 Anandaram and Gunabhiram were instrumental in organising Gyan Pradayini Sabha in 1857 at Nowgong with the object of spreading advanced knowledge amongst the people. It had fifty to sixty members, of whom about one-third regularly attended the meetings which were usually held on Sundays.29 The name of Ganga Gobinda Phukan is associated with the organisation of two associations-Asamiya Sahitya Sabha in Calcutta (1872) and Upper Assam Association at Sibsagar (1880). On 21 May, on behalf of the former Sabha Jagannath Baruah and Manik Chandra Baruah, then college students in Calcutta, submitted a memorial to Lord Northbrook urging him to improve communications of Assam with Bengal with the object of developing her resources. Mention has already been made that the Asamiya Bhasa Unnati Sadhini Sabha though it originated in Calcutta with the object of promoting Assamese language and literature contributed in no less degree in arousing a sense of unity and a spirit of patriotism amongst the Assamese.
30
The emergence of the aforesaid associations and organisations, within and outside the province, was a clear indication of the general awakening of the people. Before long, there was also a change in the tone of these associations which was noticeable in the organisation and workings of the Tezpur Ryot Sabha which had its birth in the eighties on the last century. The Sabha was formed to ventilate the grievances of

the people, mainly of the agricultural ryots, against the enhancement in revenues on land. Of the leading members of the association, mention may be made of Haribilas Agarwala, Lambodar Borah, Lakshmi Kanta Barkakoti, Jaidev Sarmah, Mohendra Dey and Thakur Das Sarmah. In order to hold regular meetings, the Sabha is said to have constructed a Town Hall by raising subscription from the public and thereby making them interested in its programme of activities."
The foundation of the Sarbajanik Sabha al Jorhat in 1884 by Jagannath Baruah is a landmark in the history of political associations in Assam. Son of an Assamese tea-planter Jagannath had his higher education his higher education at the Presidency College, Calcutta, at a time when there was a new awakening in Bengal. The activities of the British Indian Association and Indian Association must have impressed him with the necessity of organising a similar organisation in Assam to awaken the political consciousness of the Assamese. The founder President of the Sabha was Raja Naranarayan Singha alias Majumelia Raja. Jagannath Baruah was its Secretary. Though the headquarters of the Sabha was located at Jorhatits activities extended all over the province and its membership, too, was open to all irrespective of caste, creed community." The Sabha was organised, in the words of Jagannath Baruah,

For the purpose of representing the wishes and aspirations of the people to the government, explaining to the people the objects and policies of the government and generally ameliorating the condition of the people.33

against the Assam Land and Revenue Regulations of 1886 in its resolution on 2 June, it deplored that the introduction of such a measure of importance by an ordinance the government had deprived the people of their right of discussion through the legislature. In another resolution the Sabhá recorded its deep sense of regret in the concentration of authority in the hands of the Chief Commissioner and conferment of plenary powers on Revenue officers restricting thereby the jurisdiction of the civil courts.34 In 1893 when there occurred popular uprisings in different parts of the province as a sequel to the revenue measures of the government, the Sabha espoused the cause of the agricultural ryots and thereby incurred the displeasure of the official circles. In the same year, in its memorial to the Royal Commission on opium, the Jorhat Sarbajanik Sabha desired abolition of the cultivation of the poppy by gradual doses; a sudden and immediate abolition would be disastrous to those who could not survive without its use. Rightly it argued, that such a measure would generate discontentment of the ryots; experience showed that the government would raise the assessment on other lands to compensate the loss of revenues on areas under poppy which would fall pressingly on the ryots."
35
The educational policy of the government was also viewed with serious concern by the Jorhat Sarbajanik Sabha. The abolition of the second grade college at Gauhati as an "unsuccessful institution" without making any endeavour to remove the causes of its failure, in the opinion of the Sabha, was highly "injudicious". The subsequent reduction in the number of scholarships was equally detrimental to the higher education in the valley although doors for "scheduled appointments" were closed to the local candidates on the ground that they lacked requisite qualifications for these situations.36

<content>Jorhat Sarbajanik Sabha
In its lengthy memorial on 14 December 1892 to the Chief Commissioner, the Sabha expressed its dissatisfaction that the number of "natives of the soil" in the executive services was extremely meagre. During the period 1874-92, it was pointed out, the posts of Extra Assistant Commissioner had been offered to ten Assamese and seven Sylhetees whilo as many as nineteen to non-residents of the province.³7 In 1893, though there were thirty-two graduates in the Assam Valley, the services of twenty-five were not utilised by the government, while in the Surma Valley out of fifty graduates not even one was appointed as Extra Assistant Cominissioner. "It is hardly necessary to say", the memorialists represented, "that natives of this province... have a natural ambition to serve their own country and sovereign; and in this honourable desire they are entitled to receive encouragement so far as it is consistent with efficiency."38 The Subha did not contemplate to make the executive posts the sole preserve of the Assamese; rather it welcomed that a certain percentage of these should be thrown open to outsiders, Indians and non-Indians. What it wanted was that the main body of the service should be recruited from the natives of the province and the proportion should not be less than three-fourths of the whole. The efficiency in administration demanded, Sabha admitted, meritorious candidates, if need be, from outside the province but in case of candidates of equal merit natives of the soil should get preference, as was in Bengal or

In his letter to the Secretary, Government of India on 6 April 1904, F. G. Monahan, Secretary to the Chief Commissioner of Assam also remarked: "it is only to be expected that the local feelings should be to oppose to grant to outsiders of what were rightly or wrongly, regarded to be the prizes of life, and it is possible that Assam would have advanced more rapidly than has been the case had employment of foreigners been prohibited on the lines that has been followed for many years past in the Central Provinces".

elsewhere.39 The Sabha further pleaded that due consideration be given to local candidates for appointments in the departments of Forest, Police, Post and Telegraphs which were so long the monopoly of the non-Assamese.
The Jorhat Sarbajanik Sabha not only demanded larger employment of the natives of the soil, but also emphasised on the improvement of their service conditions and emoluments. It deprecated the policy of the government of gradual reduction in the pay scales of the Extra Assistant Commissioners from rupees eight to six hundred since the reconstitution of the province in 1874. Inadequate inducements had compelled, it was added, even covenanted officers to seek transfer to Bengal where they had better prospects of promotion besides amenities of a metropolitan life. Bengal was thus enabled to utilise the services of a number of experienced officers who had initial training at the expense of Assam taxpayers. Every endeavour should be made, the Sabha urged, to retain the services of those officers by improving their prospects and increasing their emoluments. 10
In March 1900 Lord Curzon paid a visit to Assam. It afforded the European planting community the golden opportunity to represent their interests for expansion of industrial and commercial undertakings in Assam. In an address of welcome J. Alston, the Superintendent Assam Frontier Tea Company Limited, Dibrugarh, appealed to the Viceroy to improve the lines of communication and means of transport in the province and also to conduct a survey of the mineral resources in the neighbouring hill tracts. In their opinion this would stimulate private enterprise and augment, thereby, the revenues of the government. The Assamese public were also not slow in according a cordial welcome to the Viceroy who had visited for the first time this frontier province. In

an address read by Jagannath Baruah on 13 March at Gauhati the people of Assam expressed their deep sense of loyalty to the British government and fondly hoped that the august visit of the Viceroy would bring in immense benefit to this much neglected province. It laid stress on the urgency of completion of the Assam-Bengal Railways then under construction to afford better facilitics for the development of the province. 12 Further it represented that long term leases should be granted to the ryots with the right of sub-letting the tract since existing short term tenures had not improved the condition of the ryots nor favoured extention of cultivation in Assam. The most significant point that was urged in the address was the representation of the Assamese in the Imperial Legislature. Assam like the Central Province, it was pointed out, had no Legislative Council of its own. Therefore, the public prayed that a permanent seat be allotted to Assam in Indian Legislative Council."

Curzon was struck by the warmth and spontaneity of welcome that was given to him by the people of Assam. In his reply the Viccroy intimated that steps were being taken to expedite the completion of railways on both the banks of the Brahmaputra and that at no distant future the government would consider even the construction of a bridge over that mighty river to connect the rail-heads." With respect to short term tenures, he explained that climatic conditions of Assam had compelled the government to adopt such measures; but he hoped that sympathetic consideration would be given by the government on the rate of assessment. The Viceroy however, regretted that the question of a permanent seat in the Legislative Council could not be conceded to in the absence of "substantial community of interests" which would render

one delegate truly representative of the whole province. Morcover, he added, the number of seats available for the whole country was then only five. "If I were to undertake permanently to allot one of these seats to Assam", he concluded, "I should be adopting a course that would not necessarily be conducive to the representative character of the Council itself". Curzon nevertheless assured the Assamese public to give provincial representation "from whatever section of the community when called for the Legislative Programme of the Government".45

The foundation of Indian National Congress in 1885 marks the beginning of a new era in the nationalist movement of India. It appears that the first meeting of the National Conference that preceded the Indian National Congress was attended by delegates from Tezpur and Sylhet.46 The First session of the Congress which was held at Bombay was rather a congress of "volunteers". But even to that Congress a telegrain was sent from Assain welcoming the idea of the Congress and wishing its success. ¹7 The second session of the Congress (1886) held in Calcutta was of a different character. Unlike volunteers of the first session, this Congress was represented by representatives of various associations and delegates duly elected at public meetings in different provinces. In Assain, Debi Charan Baruah and Gopinath Bardoloi represented Upper Assam Association ; Shillong Association was represented by Kalikauta Barkakoti; Satyanath Borah was a representative of Nowgong Ryot Association; Bipin Chandra Pal represented Sylhet Association, Joy Gobinda Shome and Kamini Kumar Chanda represented Habiganj People's Association. In the third session held in Madras (1887) the following representatives from

The representatives from Assam were not merely silent observers; some of them actively participated in the proceedings of the Congress. On the eve of the second session of the Congress, in a well represented public meeting held at Murarichand School, Sylhet, several recommendations were made which were later discussed and carried out as resolutions by the open session of the Congress.¹ the Congress.19 In the same session when the Congress moved the ninth resolution demanding withdrawal of powers vested in the Sessions Judges and High Courts setting aside in certain cases verdicts of the jury, Debi Charan Baruah stood opposed to it from the standpoint of Assam. In Assam, he argued, where a planters Raj was working the jury system would give them a handle to intensify their oppressions particularly On tea-garden employees. In those regions, European quota in jury being the most numerous, the system had been highly injurious chicfly in cases in which Europeans were involved and where "their verdict is not always in conformity with the evidence or dictates of justice." He would, of course, welcome the system if the number of European members were reduced to one-half and the remaining half taken from the natives of Assam which would minimise chances of injustices to the

"That this meeting is of opinion that it has now became necessary alike in the interest of India and England to reconstruct the Legislative Councils on the basis that "no less than twothird of the whole council should be elected members chosen by the local bodies" and "that the council they formed should have the right of interpellation". Further that "the maximum age of the Civil Service Examination should be raised to 23 years"; and that "open competitive examinations should be held in India simultaneously in England".

lution on the ground that it led to the miscarriage of justice like that of Assam where European element in the jury was predominating.51
THE PRESS AND POLITICAL ASSOCIATIONS
Opinion however differed on the jury system even amongst the representatives of Assam. On the abolition of the jury, in the Congress at Allahabad (1892) Lakshminath Bezbaruah, a delegate from Assam, strongly advocated the reintroduction of the system on the ground that the trial by jury was as old in Assam as the British rule. "If there is any province in India", he contended, "which wants trial by jury more than any other, it is Assam", since Assam was a nonRegulation province with a backward and poor people, majority of them being illiterate. Morcover, "raw and inexperienced civilians are generally imported into Assam who not only administer justice in a lawless manner but tyrannise over the people", and Assam had no good barrister or advocate to safeguard against the miscarriage of justice.52
A true representative of the new age, Debi Charan Baruah had firm faith in representative government. In the second session of the Congress when the question of representation and local autonomy came under discussion, Baruah said:
Unless representative system is introduced the real wants of the country can scarcely be met. Allowing freely (that) foreigners and strangers as they are to all that most intimately affect us, (they) are actuated by the highest motives and do their best for us, the present state of the country and the universal feeling that pervades it, sufficiently show that neither the purity of their intention nor the conscientiousness of their efforts can compensate for the want of the practical sympathy with a detailed knowledge of the circunstances of our case, which only our people, carefully selected can supply.5.

for his pro-Indian views. On behalf of the "wretched and down-trodden slave population of Assam", Bipin Chandra Pal offered his felicitations to him for his endeavours to champion the cause of Assam "Coolies" in the Parliament. He also thanked the working classes in England "who have in the past expended their money and their blood on removing shackles of the slaves in every part of the world".5¹4 In fact, the problem of the tea-garden labour led to animated discussion in several sessions of the Indian National Congress. In 1896 Congress, Jogesh Chandra Ghosh, a delegate from Calcutta presented a vivid picture of the horrible condition prevailing in the traffic in labour in the tea plantations in Assam. He condemned the existing laws which were enacted to supply cheap labour to European planters in unhealthy tea-tracts of Assam. The rules created a class of recruiters called the Arkatis whose power of mischief was "regretted alike by the officials, planters and the people". The Arkatis took the nefarious system of "forcible kidnapping" and "fraudulent misrepresentations" as means of recruiting labourers. This made the lives of the poor victims so miserable that sometimes they had to take recourse to suicide.5" The relevant Act was enacted in consideration of the difficulties of transportation; but in view of improved transportation this became wholly unnecessary and so it should be repealed. Bipin Chandra Pal also gave illustration of the horrible aspects of this "quasi slavery" system and said that the act should be repealed "if for no other consideration but of regard for the freedom that is the birth right of every British subject and out of regard of the fair name of England". Rajani Kanta Sarkar another delegate from Bengal also supported the proposal which was then put to vote and carried by acclamation.56

the Congress in that year Bipin Chandra Pal, one of the main architects of the movement, strongly advocated the cause of Swadeshi for securing the redress of all political grievances. To make the movement a success not only should there be a boycott of foreign goods but also of honorary offices and association with government. In his view boycott had already become a force to be reckoned with and would remain so until "every right", "every liberty" and "the highest destiny" of the nation were achieved.57
During the period of partition agitation there had emerged several associations, the details of their organisation and workings are not much known. The Assam Valley and the Surma Valley branches of the Indian Tea Association intimated their approval of Curzon's partition scheme on condition that the change should not have the effect of depriving the province of the name of "Assam" for its tea which had gained a world wide reputation.58 The Mahishya Samiti of Eastern Bengal and Assam, too, supported the government scheme of partition."9 On the other hand, Bande Mataram Samiti was formed in Sylhet in 1906 to encourage Swadeshi and the idea of nationalism.60 Muslim Associations like Anjuman-I-Islamia, Silchar, Sylhet Anjuman, Muhammedan Association of Maulavi Bazar, Anjuman-1-Itehad of Habiganj took part in the propartition agitation. The influence of terrorist activities of the period led to the formation of local branches of Anusilan Samiti, Suhrid Samiti, and Suhrid Sevak Samiti mainly in the districts of Sylhet and Cachar.62 A terrorist organisation-the

169
The Surma Valley Association which had its birth on 11 August 1906 played a significant rôle in rousing political consciousness of the people of the Surma Valley. Of its earlier members mention may be made of Radha Binode Das, Sarada Charan Shyam, Brajalal Das Choudhury, Harish Chandra Ray, Bipin Chandra Pal, Rajkumar Banerjee and Brajendra Krishna Ray Choudhury. This association was established, as enunciated in the fourth resolution of the first meeting of the Association (1906),
With the avowed object of promoting the general welfare of the people of this valley and taking practical ps for ameliorating the conditions of the masses in matters of sanitation, agriculture and such other matters.61
In reality, the Association provided the political forum of the nationalist leaders of the Surma Valley in the carly decades of the present century. That the members of the Association were imbued with the spirit of nationalism is evident from the fact that the whole proceedings of the Surma Valley Conferences of 1906 and 1908 were filled with nationalist songs sung by eminent singers like Kanailal Goswami of Calcutta and nationalist cries of Sankirtan and Bande Mataram. The conference openly supported the establishment of national schools, Swadeshi movement and physical training of the youths and the art of lathi and sword play. Though the policy and programme of the Association was intensely nationalistic, its nationalism did not degenerate into terrorism. Nor did it follow the policy of "appeasing moderation"; "petition had no place in its deliberations".66

The Association had its first conference in 1906 at Jalsuka in the district of Sylhet under the presidentship of Kamini Kumar Chanda. Besides two hundred delegates mainly of the mirasdars, merchants and lawyers from different parts of the valley, about one thousand visitors attended the session. The proceedings of the second conference held at Karimganj in April 1908 provide a clear picture as to the nature and workings of this Association. In his presidential address Radha Binode Das affirmed that the ideal of the Association was Swaraj as preached by Dadabhai Naoroji in the Calcutta session of the Indian National Congress in 1906. He wanted that the Indians without any distinction of caste and creed should have opportunity to grow to the full height of stature so that India might attain and maintain her proper place among the great nations of the world. He called upon the members of the Association to bring out a team of dedicated workers to move about in the villages to preach the gospel of Swaraj, Swadeshi and Boycott-spreading education amongst the masses, instilling into their minds the supreme need of unity and removing their mental, physical and material warts. Speaking of the critical situation he said:
68
We are as it were in the midst of a whirlwind. It is God alone who can pilot our nation's "boat" through the storm-tossed seas safe into the harbour of peace, security and greatness.6 69
news items of these papers was that there existed a Central Committee as permanent body at Sylhet besides sub-divisional Committees in different localities. The exact relations between the Central and local committees remained ill-defined. The local newspapers therefore opined that it was essentially necessary that the governing bodies of the Association, whether central or sub-divisional committees, should be definite in character and elected on the suffrage of the members of the Association. When the second Surma Valley Conference met at Karimganj in 1908, there was heated and animated discussion on the subject, but nothing is known about the final decision.

Therefore
we must pledge our unswerving fidelity to the great cause, we must be united and we must proceed cautiously. We must organise our religious, social, political and economic life in a way so that this great nation, instead of sinking into deep abyss may advance towards its God-appointed goal.70
Bipin Chandra Pal who had also addressed the conference asserted that Swaraj was the goal of India without which humanity would suffer. Only a free India could fulfil her mission in the world. India under British autocracy was a menace even to liberal England.
For the progress of the world, for the maintenance of peace between Asia and Europe, and for the cause of humanity, must India take her place as one of the free nations of the earth and the teacher of mankind.71
In its resolutions, the conference extended its wholehearted support towards the Swadeshi movement for the amelioration of the condition of the masses-to enable them to live on their own strength. It resolved that attainment of Swaraj was the political goal of the conference and the only efficient means to reach that goal was the cultivation and development of unity and strength of the people. It urged the Association to appoint preachers and to distribute pamphlets to inculcate in the masses the lessons on agriculture, industries and sanitation." 72 The Association thus kept the Surma Valley abreast with nationalist throb and made it one of the most politically advanced areas of India.
The death of Jagannath Baruah in April 1907 and subsequent division amongst its membors practically terminated the activities of the Jorhat Sarbajanik Sabha. The need was already felt amongst the Assamese elite of a broad based provincial organisation to represent to the government the

wishes and aspirations of the people. The opportunity to form such an association came to Manik Chandra Baruah and a few others in carly 1903 when about forty leading persons gathered at Gauhati to meet Sir Denzil Ibbetson, Member of the Viceroy's Executive Council, who was on an official visit to Assam.73 The ground was thus prepared for the organisation of the Assam Association which had played a significant part in the political advancement of the province prior to the emergence of the Assam Provincial Congress in 1921.
Information with respect to the constitution of the Association is extremely meagre. All that we know is, besides the central organisation with headquarters at Gauripur and Gauhati, it had branches in several towns of the province. In its first session held at Dibrugarh in April 1905, the Association formally elected Manik Chandra Baruah as its General Secretary and Raja Prabhat Chandra Baruah and Jagannath Baruah as President and Vice-President respectively." Though meetings were held from time to time to discuss vital issues, until 1916 the Association had no regular annual sessions. Nevertheless, Manik Chandra Baruah, the soul of the Association kept its flag flying.* During these years, it is not an exaggeration to say, the Assam Association was "one man's show"-that of its General Secretary.
The Association served as the mouth-piece of the people of Assam in presenting to the authorities their "needs and grievances, hopes and aspirations". Its sponsors did not

It is believed in certain quarters that an organisation of the same name existed in Upper Assam as carly as 1882; but the real beginning of the Assam Association can be traced to 1903 when a reference of it was made as "an institution of recent birth' by F. J. Monahan, Chief Secretary to the Chief Commissioner, to the Secretary, Government of India in his letter on 6 April 1904. See PP(H.C.), 1906, vol. 81; Enclosure 4 in No. 2, p. 663.

believe in action-oriented programmes of the raijmels or village assemblics, but pinned their faith on constitutional agitationthat redress of grievances of the people and reform in administrations could be effected by prayers and petitions. Resolutions which were adopted in general sessions after due deliberations on all burning questions of the day were forwarded to the government for its consideration. Since its leading members like Manik Chandra Baruah, Ghanashyam Baruah, Phanidhar Chaliha, Tarun Ram Phookun, Nabin Chandra Bardoloi were also legislators of the time, they could draw the attention of the government through their speeches and debates in the floor of the Councils to the resolutions and demands of the Assam Association passed from time to time. The effective rôle played by the members of the Association in the Provincial and Central Legislative Councils has been dealt with in a subsequent chapter.
173
Within a few months of its birth, the Association was called upon by the Chief Commissioner to give its views on the proposed extension of territorial jurisdiction of Assam by the incorporation of certain districts of Eastern Bengal.75 In conformity with the resolutions of the meetings held by its branches at Goalpara, Barpeta, Gauhati, Nowgong, Tezpur, Golaghat and Dibrugarh-in a general meeting held at Gauripur under the presidentship of Raja Prabhat Chandra Baruah, the Assam Association protested against the scheme of incorporation fearing that Assam would not only be deprived of her independent status but her people would be subjected to alien rules and regulations prevailing in the districts of Bengal. Later, the Association 'stoutly opposed the sinister plan of excluding Assam from the general scheme of reforms in 1918.

Planters' Association, Ahom Association and Assam Valley Muhammedan Association laid stress on their respective communal or sectional interests, the Assam Association alone stood for the unity and integrity of Assam."7 The Association's consistent stand in regard to the reforms and its bold step in sending a deputation even to London ultimately convinced the authorities of the justice and reasonableness of its demands. As a result, Assam was declared a major province equal in status with other provinces in India.
Although the Association attended to the specific problems of Assam, it did not cut itself adrift from all India politics. During its early years the Association was closely observing the main trends of the nationalist movement and, in fact, prepared the ground for the struggle for freedom in this province. This was facilitated by the infiltration into it of members with nationalistic outlook like Tarun Ram Phookun, Nabin Chandra Bardoloi and Chandranath Sarmah. On the failure of the new reforms in satisfying Indian National aspirations and the subsequent repressive measures culminating in the massacre at Jallianwala Bagh, the Indian National Congress was then organising a country-wide movement of non-cooperation against the government. The younger section of the Association led by Chandranath Sarmah felt that the people of Assam should join the national movement and some of them even attended the Congress Sessions at Calcutta and Nagpur to have a first hand knowledge of the national problem.78 Being apprised of the changed situation which called forth an united effort for the attainment of the country's ultimate goal, the Association felt the desirability of changing its provincial outlook even by amending the constitution to enable its members to plunge headlong into the national movemcut.79 At the annual session of the Assam Association held at Tezpur in December 1920,

under the presidentship of Prasanna Kumar Baruah, it was resolved to adopt the programme of non-cooperation as outlined by the Nagpur Session of the Indian National Congress. Since the Association was required to identify itself with the aims and aspirations of the National Congress, it saw no useful purpose in maintaining its independent existence. In a subscquent resolution, the Association decided to merge itself in the newly formed Assam Provincial Congress which was affiliated to the Indian National Congress.80

<content>CHAPTER TEN
The Partition of Bengal and Its Aftermath
The Presidency of Bengal at one time consisted of besides Bengal proper, Bihar, Orissa, the whole of the United Province including Delhi, portions of Central Province, Chota Nagpur and Assam. "Enormous population and area of Bengal, evergrowing importance of Calcutta, constantly increasing congestion of business in Calcutta Secretariat, inability of the head of the Government to give personal attention to such a big province",' were the factors which brought forth suggestions at different times for a reorganisation of this Presidency. In fact, since the sixties of the last century the process of redistribution and readjustment of territories had begun. In 1874, Assam was taken away from Bengal and made a Chief Commissioner's province under direct control of the Governor-General in Council. In spite of it the Lieutenant Governor of Bengal had to administer one of the largest provinces of India occupying an area of 1,89,000 square miles with a population of about 78% millions. Bengal which demanded a more personal rule was considered too heavy a charge for the head of the administration to shoulder. The newly constituted Chief Commissionership of Assam was, on the other hand, considered to be too small from the administrative and economic point of view. In 1892, on strategic and administrative reasons, the Lieutenant Governor of Bengal, Chief Commissioners of Burma and Assam and military experts proposed the transfer of the Chittagong division and

the Lushai Hills to Assam, but the measure remained unimplemented. Again in 1896, Sir William Ward, Chief Commissioner of Assam suggested the transfer of Chittagong Division and the two districts of Dacca and Mymensingh to Assam ; the enlargement of the province, it was hoped, would facilitate the creation of separate services in all its branches for the efficient administration of that province. Fearing that such changes would "excite a storm of protest", the proposal was not pursued by the new Chief Commissioner Sir Henry Cotton, and the Government of India, too, paid scant attention to the scheme excepting the transference of the administration of Lushai Hills in 1897 from Bengal to Assam.5 Like Sir Henry, official circles in Bengal, the European merchants and the press stood opposed to the dimmunition in the size of the Presidency. If better administration was the goal, they suggested, Bengal should be immediately raised to the status of a governorship with an Executive Council like that of Madras and Bombay.
Early in 1903, Sir Andrew Fraser, the Lieutenant Governor of Bengal, renewed the carlier suggestion of the transfer of Chittagong division, Dacca and Mymensingh districts to Assam. J. B. Fuller, the Chief Commissioner of Assam, supported the territorial changes for speedy completion of the Assam-Bengal Railways. Since five-sevenths of its length lay within Assam, he argued, it was to this province that this railway must look for the traffic to justify its construction. But the future of this line depended on the port of Chittagong and there was hardly any doubt, he added, that this port would receive greater attention "when it was the only outlet of the province than when it has to share the consideration of the Government with a prosperous and well-established port as

Calcutta". The proposal received the approval of Curzon's government and H. H. Risley, Secretary to the Government of India, Home Department, in his letter on 3 December 1903 justified the reorganisation not only to ease the "excessive burden" of the Government of Bengal, but also to facilitate expansion of Assam "which would give the officers a wider and more interesting field of work... (above all) a maritime outlet in order to develop its industries in tea, oil and coal".8 Curzon had also an ulterior object in view. He was very much apprehensive of the solidarity and growing political consciousness of the Bengalees centering round Calcutta which was considered by him as the hot-bed of political intrigues.* He sought to destroy the "nascent nationalism in Bengal" by dividing the Bengali speaking people and taking every advantage of the separatist tendencies of the Muhammedans of the province." The full text of the resolution of the government was published in the official Gazette of India on 12 December 1903; but the final scheme was hatched up in

* In a despatch to the Secretary of the State, Curzon wrote: "Calcutta is the centre from which the Congress Party is manipulated, throughout the whole of Bengal and indeed the whole of India. Its best wire-pullers and its most frothy orators all reside here ... They frighten the local government and they are not sometimes without serious influence upon the Government of India. The whole of their activity is directed to creating an agency so powerful that they may one day be able to force a weak government to give them what they desire". Curzon Papers, Curzon to Brodrick, 2 February 1905, cited in Tarachand, History of the Freedom Movement in India, iii, p. 311.
9 Explaining Curzon's scheme, R. C. Majumdar writes: "In East Bengal, the Muslims, politically less advanced and more loyal to the British than the Hindus, would be in a majority, while in Bengal the Bengalis would form a minority by inclusion of Bihar and Orissa. Thus the Bengalis would be divided from their kith and kin; the Bengali Hindus, hated and dreaded by Curzon for their advanced political ideas would form a minority; and a thin wedge would be driven between the Hindus and Muslims of Bengal".

utmost secrecy and the opinion of the public bodies and associations, though called for, was not taken into consideration.

Inevitably the announcement of the partition scheme was followed by prayers, protestations and demonstrations throughout the province of Bengal. Resolutions, telegrams and petitions were sent to the Government of India and the Secretary of State in condemnation of the proposed partition. The press, both Indian and foreign, was very critical in its comments on the proposal. The Indian National Congress in its annual sessions held in 1903 and 1904 respectively protested against the preposterous scheme. Presiding over the Congress session in Bombay Sir Henry Cotton denounced the plan as "the most abitrary and unsympathetic evidence of irresponsible statesmenship".¹⁰
To the people of Assain the proposed amalgamation with the districts of Bengal was a bolt from the blue. Ever since British occupation, it may be remembered, Assain failed to receive adequate justice in the hands of the Lieutenant Governor of Bengal overburdened as he was with the responsibilities of an extensive province. This was remedied to a great extent by the separation of the province in 1874 under a Chief Commissioner who had exercised since then closer supervision and adopted necessary measures for the general improvement of the province. Within a period of thirty years, admittedly, much had been done towards improvement in communication by opening up several railways* and a daily steamer service on the Brahmaputra. Education at all levels received encouragement from the government and liberal and special grants were made towards the same. Assamese had been recognised as a second language in the Entrance Examination of the Calcutta University and a fair share of government appointments, though not adequate, had been offered to

the children of the soil. Above all, opportunities had been given to the people to approach the head of the State to represent matters of public interest or their grievances. But a great deal yet remained to be done to remove the appellation of "backward" which had been constantly used even by the government. To tag the province once again to the much advanced districts of Bengal would "nullify the good that has been derived" at the hands of the Chief Commissioner." In that case,
Assam proper will secure only a small fraction of the Chief Commissioner's attention, his very seat will be removed, and the people will have to meet a keen and unequal competition of highly educated, enterprising and advantageously situated districts, (because of) which they are not yet prepared for the same.1:

Under the proposed scheme, Assam Association apprehended,
the historic name of Assam will be obliterated for ever, her language (will) suffer, and the removal of the seat of the Government to a place outside Assam proper and further away from the geographical centre will necessarily make her lose the amount of care and attention which it (has) at present received from government.13
The Jorhat Sarbajanik Sabha ably refuted the contention that the Assam-Bengal Railway under the proposed changes would open up the province and contribute towards her development. In its opinion, the Railway would carry on its commercial activities whether it passed through one or more provinces. Nor did the Sabha believe that a separate administrative unit would take greater interest in the development of the Chittagong port, the natural outlet for Assam and East Bengal. The growth and development of the port, the Sabha maintained, depended not so much on the interest felt by the government as on increase in traffic brought by improved

communication.14 There can be no rebuttal when the Sabha argued :
When the Government of India do not propose to separate Orissa from Bengal owing to a political association for a century, there is certainly very much less ground for cutting up Bengal proper into two portions, the people of both portions having been not only politically associated from the earliest historical times, but also forming one people both by language and race. 15

The Advocate of Assam commented on the scheme on financial ground holding the view that the new province would be acting as a sort of drag on the exhausted Indian exchequer". The local press, in general, felt that "the situation of Assam when amalgamated with the Sylhet district was bad enough, but when tied with the advanced parts of the country, the change was from the frying pan to fire". ¹7 Jagannath Baruah, the president of the Jorhat Sarbajanik Sabha and Manik Chandra Baruah, in his individual capacity, realising that the government was determined to go ahead with its scheme, demanded sufficient reservation of the rights of the people of Assam in the new set-up.¹8 Dulal Chandra Deb, Chairman of the Municipal Committee of Sylhet, in a memorandum while opposing the inclusion of Mymensingh and Dacca districts wanted only the addition of Chittagong division to Assam which would provide it with a port in the sea. Kamini Kumar Chanda, Vice-Chairman of the Silchar Municipality, opposed the plan of partition outright.* The Bengali-speaking population of the Surma Valley vehemently opposed the partition as they would be cut off from their kith and kin in Bengal when joined to Eastern Bengal. In the new province, the Surma Valley Hindus would be reduced to a minority and the latter feared that since they were backward in education compared to the transferred districts of Bengal,

the claims of the Surma Valley people might be superseded by qualified men from Dacca, Mymensingh, Rajshahi and Assam Valley. On the otherhand the European planters of both the valleys welcomed the partition measures subject to the condition that under no circumstances the name of "Assam” for which its tea was universally known should be dropped.2"
Curzon was not the man to be unnerved by popular agitation and pressure. He was determined to carry out the scheme and partition became a fait accompli on 16 October 1905. The province of "Eastern Bengal and Assam" came into being "consisting of an area of 1,06,540 square miles and a population of 31 million souls". Sir J. B. Fuller, the Chief Commissioner of Assam, assumed charge of the new province
Lieutenant Governor at Dacca. A Legislative Council and a Board of Revenue consisting of two members were given to assist the Lieutenant Governor; the jurisdiction of the Calcutta High Court, was however left undisturbed. To win confidence of the people, soon after his assumption of new office, Fuller paid a visit to Assam. In reply to an address of welcome presented to him by the Gauhati Municipality on 1 November 1905 he said that he had no doubt that the new changes had resulted in the loss of Assam's individuality, but the enlargement of the government would be beneficial to the people of Assam in the long run-"I look forward to the day", Fuller added,
When Dacca, Chittagong, Gauhati and Sylhet will be as closed unit to one another as Benares, Allahabad, Lucknow and Agra, and when cach Assamese and each Bengali, while retaining to the full his national individuality, will also be able, when he meets acquitances from beyond the border, to boast that he belongs to Eastern Bengal and Assam. 21
He assured the people of Assain that the proposed change will not affect their privileges in the way of scholarships and

the reservations in their favour in regard to Covernment employment in the Valley, but he had to admit that with few exceptions the Assamese would be deprived of their fair share of posts in the new office establishments of the union of East Bengal and Assam since the people of East Bengal will have the priority and that it will also be the policy of the government to appoint them. As regards representation in the Lieutenant Governor's Legislative Council, Fuller assured that the local bodies of Assam would share with Bengal this privilege. 22

The partition was a "Grave National Disaster" to the people of Bengal and the latter resolved with grim determination to meet the challenge.* 16 October 1905 was observed as a day of national mourning all over Bengal. Streets of Calcutta were full of demonstrations, shops were closed and observance of protests began with bath in the Ganges, mass prayers and Rakhi Bandhan.f In the same evening, in Calcutta the foundation stone of the Federation Hall was laid by Ananda Mohan Bose, an ex-President of the Indian National Congress, as the "symbol of indissoluble union" and "meeting

*"From December 1903 to October 1905 more than 2000 public meetings attended by 500 to 50,000 people, both Hindus and Mussalmans, were held in different parts of East Bengal and West Bengal to protest against the partition. The Resolutions unanimously passed at these meetings were regularly submitted to the government of India as well as to the Secretary of State Memorials were submitted by the British Indian Association, the Bengal Land holder's Association, as well as from nearly all the important and recognised public bodies and associations in either part of the province The Indian Press both in Bengal as well as in other provinces were manimous in their condemnation of the proposed dismemberment of Bengal and even a large section of the Anglo-Indian Press, some of which were recognised as semi-official organs, joined in the protest".

Responding to the call of the Bengal leaders, protest meetings were held at Dhubri, Gauripur, Goalpara, Gauhati and Dibrugarh. In the Surma Valley, meetings were organised at Sylhet, Habiganj, Maulavi Bazar, Silchar, Karimganj and Badarpur.² In both the valleys the observance was marked by the attendance of the Hindus and Muhammedans as joint partners of the agitation. National songs were sung and processions were taken out accompanied by shouts of Bande Mataram. In some places mass prayers and Rakhi Bandhan were performed symbolising the solidarity among the different communities. The anniversary of the anti-partition day was duly observed on 16 October 1906, at several places the Assam Valley.2 At Dhubri there was a public Sankirtan in the morning which was heartily joined by all the communities-Hindus, Sikhs and the Muhammedans. This was followed by tying of Rakhis and a meeting where specches were made even by the ladies of the town. In a public meeting at Goalpara presided over by Abdul Aziz Saheb resolutions renewing Swadeshi vow for carrying on the agitation till partition was annulled or modified were passed and the first being moved by a Muhammedan. Amidst deafening shouts of Bande Mataram, at Dibrugarh Rakhi Bandhan ceremony was observed. In the evening a grand procession composed mainly of the Assamese and Muhammedan residents passed through the streets singing national anthem and shouting Bande Mataram and Alla-ho-Akbar. At Gauhati, huge procession paraded the principal streets with flags bearing

On the anniversary of the anti-partition day, at Badarpur the Hindus and the Muslims both observed Rakhi Bandhan ceremony and fasted for the whole day. In a public meeting at Maulavi Bazar resolutions were passed renewing the Swadeshi vow and supporting the scheme of moving the authorities for placing the entire Bengali-speaking population under one administrative unit.27 The Surma Valley Association kept up the agitation and strengthened people's belief in Swadeshi and Swaraj.* The frequent visit of Bipin Chandra Pal and the stirring speeches he made at the public meetings held at Habiganj, Baniachang, Badarpur, Silchar, Karimganj spread the message of Swaraj to the masses. Born and educated in the district of Sylhet, Pal started his political life under moderate Surendra Nath Banerjea. Before long he expressed his extremist views through the columns of New India and formed with Tilak and Lajpat the extremist trio "Lal-Bal-Pal". The present government, Pal said, had combined two rôles into one-trader and ruler-and consequently both administration and exploitation were moving hand in hand. Under the Hindu and Muhammedan rulers of India there was no exploitation; whatever was spent by them remained in the country. Under the rule of the Feringhis (foreign ruler) every year twenty-five crores of rupees had been taken away across the seas-resulting in famine, scarcity and appalling poverty

of the masses in India. It was impossible to check this exploitation, Pal asserted, until and unless Swaraj was established. He did not advocate a war with the Feringhis; but they must be driven to a corner and compelled to give the Indians what they wanted and this could only be effected by a boycott not alone of foreign cloth but of everything foreign. He maintained that the British rule rested on a shaky foundation. The administration was practically in the hands of the Indians; and if the latter cease to work the administration would collapse and the Feringhis would be compelled to quit. A vow should be taken not to serve the Feringhis and those who scrve should be boycotted. To him Swaraj was the system "wherein the people made their own laws, decided what taxes were to be paid, how it was to be spent, and appointed and controlled the state officials as the people of other countries did". In the opinion of the government Pal had “done immense mischief" and "it would probably take many years to remove the pernicious effects of the violent speeches from the minds of the young people".30
THE PARTITION OF BENGAL AND ITS AFTERMATH
According to a correspondent of the Bengalee who made a tour of the principal towns of Assam Valley during the beginning of the movement it was found that the attitude of the people of Assam on the whole towards partition and Swadeshi movement was favourable." At Dhubri, Goalpara and Gauhati he found much enthusiasm among the buyers for the purchase of Swadeshi goods. Although stalls were full of foreign stuff, he reported, there were no buyers for the same. At Gauhati the correspondent found the enlightened Bengali and Assamese people were using Kurkutch instead of liverpool-salt, Benares-sugar instead of foreign sugar, deshi-cloth instead of Manchester-cloth.

appealed to the pandas, the grocers and sweetmeat-sellers not to accept foreign goods or indulge in their sale and purchase in the Nilachal hills.2 Shops were started in different places for the sale of Swadeshi goods. Of the four such shops at Gauhati, the most important was the Assam Valley Trading Company, and the majority of its shareholders were local pleaders. At Tezpur and Barpeta, students and local shopkeepers took the leading part in popularising the use of indigenous goods.
The Surma Valley Association organised Swadeshi and boycott meetings at several places and a Swadeshi mission was started at Sylhet to propagate the message of Swadeshi amongst the masses in rural areas.34 What was most significant, several zamindars through their agents called upon their tenants to give up the sale and purchase of foreign goods. The zamindar's agents not unoften combined with local people exercised "coercion through the more effective and subtle weapon of social ostracism".35 In many places merchants and traders voluntarily refrained from selling foreign goods. As a result the demand for indigenous goods was on the increase. Hand-loom fabrics, ink, nib, matches, etc., were locally manufactured to meet the demands of the people while the sale of Liverpool-salt, Manchester-cloth and other foreign goods practically came to standstill.³

THE PARTITION OF BENGAL AND ITS AFTERMATH
October 1907 the Sylhet National School was established on voluntary contributions.38 The school which had its start at the residence of Sachindra Chandra Singh, editor of the Weekly Chronicle, had four buildings and playground close to Jinda Bazar. It had ayurvedic and carpentry classes following the syllabus and examinations laid down by the National Educational Committee, Calcutta. The circulars issued by the government debarring students and teachers from participating in anti-British agitations led to the starting of similar schools at Habiganj, Srimangal, Baniachang and Lakhai. 39 These institutions, which were looked upon by the official circles as the "hot-bed of seditions" exercised, in their views, the "most pernicious influence over its students"; teachers and students openly took part in organising meetings, processions and in picketing of shops selling foreign goods. Political leaflets and pamphlets like Swadhin Bharat* and Bande Mataram were widely and regularly circulated among the students who were also required to commit to memory the patriotic songs of Bankim Chandra's Anandamath.40 In an exhibition held at
8 The local pleaders and muktears who had taken keen interest in these institutions moved from place to place to raise funds for this school. A donation of rupees two hundred was made by the Surma Valley Association while Ramani Mohan Bose and Raja of Gauripur contributed rupees five hundred each. One Basanta Bairagi paid rupees three hundred to the school fund. HPB., March 1909, Nos. 10-1; see Report of the National School in the province of Eastern Bengal and Assam, Part II.

It is however not known whether attempts had been made to establish centres of national education in the Assam Valley. For the establishment of a national university in Calcutta help and co-operation had been extended and a branch of the Association for the Advancement of Scientific and Industrial Education of the Indians was formed at Dibrugarh. At Tezpur funds were raised for the Society of Agriculture and Industrial Education. HPA., June 1911, Nos. 223-4; Abstract of Intelligence, Eastern Bengal and Assam Police, 9 March 1907.

the Habiganj National School in 1909 nitric acid and hydrochloric acid prepared by the students were shown and paintings on Lala Lajpat Rai, Aurobindo Ghose and Ajit Singh were exhibited.11
Thus National Schools were used, like those in East Bengal, as centres for spreading the agitation, "students and children formed the bulk of the audience at anti-partition meetings and were organised into noisy processions that paraded the streets of moffusil towns shouting Bande Mataram and interfering with trade".12 Being alarmed at the increasing anti-British activities of the students, the Government of Eastern Bengal and Assam resorted to repressive measures one after another. In fact even before Fuller's taking over charge as Lieutenant Governor of Eastern Bengal and Assam, R. W. Carlyle, the Officiating Chief Secretary to the Government of Bengal, sent a confidential circular to the District Magistrates and Collectors directing them to take stern action against educational institutions if their managements did not prevent their students from participating in anti-governmental agitations.43 Similar circulars followed in quick succession including the one which prohibited the shouting of Bande Mataram and the holding of "Political and quasi-political meetings".41 Disciplinary actions against teachers and management of educational institutions were taken, many students were jailed, fined and expelled from their institutions. When the movement took a serious turn in certain areas of Eastern Bengal, the Government smelt sedition everywhere. Meetings and processions were banned, editors of newspapers were imprisoned and political leaders were deported." To

make matters worse, resorting to the policy of "divide and rule", Fuller sought to detract a large section of the Muhammedans who had willingly participated in the movement. "The New Administration" writes R. C. Majumdar, “openly favoured the Muslims, and the first Licutenant Governor, Fuller said with reference to the two main sections of the population, the Mussalmans and the Hindus, that they were like his two queens of the Indian legends, the first being suo (favoured) and the second duo (neglected)". Such a partisan and communal attitude not only led to estrangement of relationship between the two communities but resulted in worst possible communal riots in parts of Eastern Bengal.

Evidently the anti-partition agitation in the Surma Valley turned into a popular movement based on Swadeshi, boycott and national education. In the Assam Valley the movement was of course confined to urban areas where Bengali elements in the population predominated. The Muhammedan population of both valleys at the initial stages of the agitation made common cause with the Hindus and joined the movement. For the insistence on the observance of Hindu religious rites by the anti-partition leaders, the Muhammedans gradually began to cut themselves adrift from such agitations. The incitement of Muslim leaders like Nawab Salimullah of Dacca, bigoted Mollahs and above all the pro-Muslim sympathy of the British Indian Government turned them pro-partitionists and anti-Congress. The Muhammedan Defence Association of Calcutta and later the Muslim League (1906) played a significant part in mobilising Muslim support to the government. The former appealed to their co-religionists to celebrate 16 October as a day of rejoicing instead of joining the Hindus
Swadeshi workers, quartering punitive Police and indulging in sensational house-search, more deemed by a single act of administrative reform or progress".

în observing the same as a day of mourning. The Anjuman-iIslamia of Silchar sent delegates to attend a pro-partition meeting at Dacca on 16 October organised by the provincial Muhammedan Association of Eastern Bengal and Assam. On the same day at Maulavi Bazar, Habiganj, Sunamganj and Sylhet pro-partition meetings were organised by a section of the Muhammedans in response to the appeal of the Bengali Muslims. While asking the Muhammedaus to consider partition as a boon, the above named association reminded them that "any kind of agitation against the Government is against the cannons of Islam".48 The Mahishya community of the Surma Valley like the Muslims expressed their support and "deep loyalty to the Government". In the manifesto prepared by the Sunamganj and Dacca Mahishya Samities which was circulated amongst the members of the Mahishya community of the province, their leaders openly pronounced their “intense hatred against seditious movements", and it was claimed that they (Mahishyas) were always on the side of law, order, progress and humanity", 19

Despite wire-pullers or agent provocateurs from Bengal trying to foment communal dsiturbance in several towns of Assam by spreading wild runours,"" riots of a communal nature did not flare up in Assam mainly because local Muslims in both the valleys remained unconcerned with such false propaganda. On the contrary, on the anniversary of the partition day, at Dibrugarh great indignation prevailed at Nawab

Salimullah's endeavours to create a division between the two communities. Two effigies of the Nawab were reported to have been made; one of these was buried by the Muhammedans and the other burnt by the Hindus.51 In his presidential address at the second meeting of the Surma Valley Conference, Radha Binode Das deplored that the game of "favourite wife" so assiduously played by the British had the effect of winning the Muslims from the Hindus and what was worse, at places they were in open hostility against them. He reminded them that "for centuries we have lived as brotherly neighbours sharing each other's miseries and bound by a thousand ties". He was confident that these two communities would not remain engaged in cutting each other's throats for any length of time.5:

The Partition of Bengal widened the rift which had in the meantime developed between the Moderates and the Extremists in the Indian National Congress. While the Moderates aimed at having a colonial form of self-government which was to be achieved through peaceful, gradual and constitutional methods, the Extremists with their firm faith in the efficacy of boycott wanted Swaraj or complete independence. There had also emerged about this time extreme radicals or terrorists who sought the salvation of the motherland by

Revolutionary Societies
adopting revolutionary methods through secret organisations and activities including shooting and intimidating reactionary officials and looting of government arms and treasurics. In Bengal not less than five revolutionary societies sprang up; of these Anusilan Samiti of Dacca and Suhrid Samiti of Mymensingh extended their activities by establishing branches in different parts of the province. The Suhrid Samiti at Sylhet was reported to have collected funds from the business community and threatened them with dire consequences if they indulged in the sale of foreign goods. Intelligence had also reached the government of the existence of a gun-factory run by the Samiti in the north of Sylhet on the border of the Garo hills. Some members of the Samiti, it was believed by the official circles, were involved in the Alipur conspiracy case* and three of its members were arrested in this connection.53
The role of the Arunachal Ashram near Silchar founded by Gurudas Choudhury, later Dayananda Swami, is highly significant in the history of the revolutionary movement." It had two branches-Gauri Gauranga Ashram at Dinajpur and Jagatshi Ashram at Baniachang in the Maulavi Bazar sub-division, district of Sylhet. The Ashram had a mouth-piece of its own, the Praja Sakti-published under the editorship of Mohendra Nath De at Habiganj. Apparently the Ashrams were religious and charitable organisations, but the government considered these as "disreputable institutions", a nest of immorality", "nuisance to the villagers", and “a haunt of sedition mongers masquerading as Sudhus".55 The Ashrams

were no doubt the rendezvous of the youngmen and women having firm faith in Swadeshi and Swaraj. They were reported to have denounced the British government and Dayananda was even said to have warned its officials that "unless they joined the Ashram within six months they will cease to exist".* Police suspicion was deepened when Dayananda declared, "we are not under the government, we have cut off all connection between the King and the subject".56
Matters came to a head on 8 July 1912, when on the pretext of rescuing a minor boy alleged to have been kidnapped by the Ashramites, the police raided the Jagatshi Ashram. In the scuffle that followed between the police and the Sadhus, a police officer was hit by a trisul (trident). The police resorted to firing and a bullet struck Mohendra Nath De, the editor of the Praja Sakti, who succumbed to his injuries.57 The subsequent arrest and imprisonment of Dayananda and some of his followers raised storm of protests in the press and platform alike. The Bengalee (24 July) questioned the justification of firing and the Amrita Bazar Patrika (20 July) demanded "a full and open enquiry".58 Anonymous letters threatening severe reprisals were issued to Deputy Commissioner, Sylhet, Sub-divisional officer, Maulavi Bazar, and several others unless Dayananda and his followers were released forthwith. In fact, on 27 March 1913, an abortive attempt was made on the life of G. Gordon, sub-divisional officer, Maulavi Bazar; but the assailant who was found heavily armed got himself killed when the bomb accidentally exploded before time." The

incident at Maulavi Bazar and the anonymous letters subsequently addressed to the Deputy Commissioner and other officials, strengthened the belief that Dayananda and his party acted in collaboration with the revolutionaries in Bengal. In a letter to the Deputy Commissioner on 23 May, an Arunachal Sevak wrote:
Saheb, Magistrate Saheb. Are you not awake even now. Release our Dayananda Thakur and others and do justice . . . Must bear in mind that India will soon be free (i.c. independent). What have you understood by bomb affair? Are you frightened? You (all) are not safe at our hands until you have allowed us to walk and move freely and have abstained from torturing us. India shall not bear persecution any longer.

Although official reports are lacking as to the activities of the revolutionaries in the valley of the Brahmaputra, the existence of a centre of disaffection at Gauhati was suspected by the police when inflamatory literature of the Yugantar typo was found in some hostels and the notice board of the Cotton College, Gauhati. The voluntary organisation-the Sera Sangha-under Ambikagiri is said to have developed into a terrorist organisation on the lines of the Anusilan Samiti, for which even personal contacts were made with some revolutionaries of Bengal.

ammunitions to overawe the police and murder high officials of the government including Bamfylde Fuller, the Lieutenant Governor of Eastern Bengal and Assam.62 The inherent weakness of the organisation, paucity in the number of members and above all strict vigilance of the police prevented the Sangha from making much headway in its activities.
In fact, the Assamese elite who had little faith in revolutionary activities denounced terrorism in any form and shape. Lakshminath Bezbaruah had condemned the very idea of liberating the country through terrorist methods. In an article "Bom" published in Kripabar Bar Baruar Bhabar Burburani, he had totally disapproved the cult of violence as had been adopted by the educated youths of Bengal in climinating unpopular officials. There was no bravery, he said, in such activities, it was nothing but cowardice. Syed Muhammad Saadullah expressed in the floor of the Assam Legislative Council the detestation of the Muslims and the Hindus of the Surma Valley at the anarchical attempt" and "diabolical design" at Maulavi Bazar." The Swadeshi movement as such was commended by the local press as "a potent remedy for combating the alleged growing poverty in India", but it condemned the violent activities of the extremists." "We should hoot out those persons" remarked the Asam Banti,
Who may come from other provinces to disseminat sedition among the people of Assam. Our people should discontinue subscribing to such newspapers as are permeated with seditious sentiments.66

Even the Weekly Chronicle, which was critical of the repressive measures of the government, condemned the terrorist activities at Muzaffarpur* inasmuch as
such outrageous methods of political agitation were not only foreign, but absolutely revolting to the spirit of the Indian culture and civilization. And we think that in the interest of the very cause which these misguided enthusiasts sought to advance, theso organisations should be stamped out root and branch.68
To combat the spurt of terrorist activities the Government of India passed several repressive measures in quick succession. Mention may be made in this connection of (i) the Seditions Meetings Act (1907), (ii) the Explosive Substance Act (1908), (iii) the Newspapers (Incitement to offences) Act (1908), (iv) the Criminal Law Amendment Act (1908) and (v) Indian Press Act (1910). Ordinances and enactments were also made restricting the right of free speech, criticism of government policy, taking out of processions, demonstrations, etc. In Assam the Criminal Law Amendment Act was freely exercised by the local authorities to prohibit staging of dramas and jatras with seditious tendencies.69 Besides restrictions on the press and platform, extremist leaders of prominence were deported or sentenced to long term imprisonment.

Morley-Minto Reforms and Assam
When towards the close of 1905 the general elections in England returned the Liberal Party to power, John Morley, "a student of Burke, a disciple of Mill and a friend and biographer of Gladstone" became the Secretary of State for India. The new Secretary of State was not slow to realise that repression alone would not restore normalcy in the Indian subcontinent, that endeavours need be made to rally the loyal elements, otherwise the British government will lose their support and "moral claim to rule". Curzon's successor Lord Minto in spite of his obsession that "the very existence of our Raj in India depended upon the evidence of strength" also felt that the anti-British elements could be checked only by "skillful division of the enemy forces" and "a dexterous combination of ruthlessness and affability". Morley was told: "we are here a small British garrison surrounded by millions composed of factors of an inflammability unknown to the western world and we must be physically strong or go to the wall".2 There must be an effective counterpoise to the growing Indian nationalism and this could be supplied by weaning over the Muslims from the Hindus. To that end Minto prepared the ground when he affirmed the Muslim delegation at Simla on 1 October 1906 that "any electoral representation in India would be doomed to mischievous failure which aimed at granting a personal enfranchisement regardless of the beliefs

and traditions of the communities composing the population of this continent". He assured them that in the event of administrative reorganisation their claim would be estimated "not merely on their numerical strength but in respect to their political importance in the country and the services it rendered to the empire". Minto's assurances being dittoed by Morley were embodied in the Government of India Act, 1909 or Morley-Minto Reforms. The Muslims were granted under the Regulations not only separate electorate but additional membership not warranted by the numerical strength of their population.
The discussion on constitutional reforms both in England and India raised high hopes amongst the people of Assam that their legitimate aspirations would also be fulfilled. This had afforded them at least the opportunity to demand annulment of the partition, a sine qua non for removing the present maldies of Assam which had been aggravated by her amalgamation with the districts of Eastern Bengal. A few Assamese residents of Calcutta led by Raja Prabhat Chandra Baruah, President of the Assam Association, prepared a memorial to be placed before the Secretary of State praying for separation of Assam from Eastern Bengal. The memorial which was signed amongst others by Manik Chandra Baruah, the General Secretary of the Association, pointed out that the partition had reversed the whole process of development which was set in motion since her separation from Bengal in 1874. The union of Assam with the advanced districts of Bengal had brought in its train a new set of rules and regulations for recruitment to executive and judicial services of the province.

<content>Assam Association's Memorial to the Secretary of State 201
The new administration had not only declared that it would protect the interest of the Muhammedans of Eastern Bengal but assured them of larger number of appointments under the rules. Educationally, too, Assam was yet to fall in line with the transferred districts of Bengal. The only College in the Brahmaputra Valley-the Cotton College-was not of the standard of the Dacca College. The memorialists regretted that the Lieutenant Governor had turned down the demand for upgrading of this institution on the ground that Ranchi needed a college to cater to the educational needs of that region. Consequently, prospects of educationally backward youths of Assam was becoming very bleak in the face of competition from their counterparts of advanced areas of Bengal. The memorialists in conclusion added that hitherto the Chief Commissioner and other high officials paid frequent visits to the different parts of the Brahmaputra Valley; but the Lieutenant Governor "will be unable to devote as much time as is necessary for proper administration of Assam" since he will be preoccupied with the affairs of Bengal. In consideration of these facts, the memorialists demanded that
G
The present partition be withdrawn and that a Governor and Council be appointed for the whole of Bengal (old and the new province) including Assam, and Assam be placed under a separate Commissioner with a separate service, but reserving a seat for an Assamese on the Council and that its administration should be assimilated to that of Sindh. Such an arrangement would be most convenient to the people of Assam and would be in harmony with the popular opinion of the province.7
The representation of the memorialists was a cry in wilderness since the Secretary of State was not prepared to unsettle a "settled fact". There was also none in central or provincial legislatures to look after the interests of Assam. The Indian Council Act of 1861 set up a Council for the Bengal Division, but Assam was left out of its scope although it formed a part

of the Presidency. In the Imperial Legislative Council following the Councils Act of 1892, the only representative from Assam was an Englishman-James Buckingham who was concerned with the interest of the European planting community. Even in the Council of Eastern Bengal and Assam, the interest of the people of Assam always went in default. The non-Assamese members of the Council took little or no interest in the affairs of Assam and in fact some of them were so much allergic to this province that they could not tolerate the retention of the very name "Assam" in the provision of a certain Act.8

It was indeed a sigh of relief when in 1908 for the first time Manik Chandra Baruah was elected to the Council by the Local Boards of Assam and Bengal. In his maiden speech in the Council, Baruah exposed the evil effects from which Assam had suffered since the partition of Bengal. When Assam had again been annexed to a part of Bengal, he said, "we are reminded of the early days of the British rule during which our best interests were sacrificed". By partition "Assam has suffered most" and under new arrangements "both the Ahoms and the Assamese Hindus are in great danger of being elbowed out of all government as well as industrial employment by the people of West Bengal" and that unless special measures were taken, he was afraid, Assamese and their language were "in great danger of being crushed out".10 He, therefore, appealed to the Government to take special interest concerning the people of Assam as they formed a minority in the new province. In support of his argument, he pointed out, that in proportion to her population Assam should pay ten per cent of the total revenue while she actually contributed thirty-three per cent. She was thus four times more heavily taxed than Eastern Bengal. Since Assam was much more highly assessed than the other and more fortunate part of the province in

relation to population, he maintained "Assam is entitled to a much larger share of revenue for improvement of her material condition".¹¹
The addition of three Assamese members to the CouncilBhuban Ram Das, Prabhat Chandra Baruah and Syed Abdul Majid-following the Act of 1909, emboldened Manik Baruah to plead more forcefully the needs and requirements of the province. He deplored in his speech on the policy of the government in raising the land revenue at every settlement without reference to the productive capacity of the land or the condition of the ryots.¹2 He damanded "exclusive rights of the children of the soil" to the public services of the country. The main architect of the Cotton College, Gauhati, Manik Chandra Baruah never failed to plead for its growth and development for the spread of higher education in the eastern region of India. Improvement of communication by rail, road and water, agriculture, industries, trade and public health received equal attention of Baruah and his colleagues in the Council. 13
The establishment of representative Parliamentary government in India remained "a mere dream" under the Act of 1909. Minto stated in unambiguous terms that "representative Government in its western sense is totally inapplicable to the Indian Empire and would be uncongenial to the tradition of the Eastern population".14 Morley echoed the same sentiment when he said in the House of Commons: "I should not be taken to indicate for a moment that I dream you can transplant British Institutions wholesale into India I do not insist that India should be on the same footing as our selfgoverning colonies like Canada".15 Consequently the reforms

"afforded no answer and would afford no answer to Indian Political problems".¹6 The Extremists rejected the reforms outright and even the Moderates who were jubilant at the initial stage saw the dangerous consequences of the policy of "Divide and Rule" and the innovation of separate electorate for the Muslims in India. The political situation, therefore, remained unaltered and the "vicious circle of terrorist outrage and savage repression" continued unabated. Lord Hardinge who succeeded Minto in 1910 clearly saw that "if there was to be peace in two Bengals it was absolutely necessary to do something to remove what was regarded by all Bengalis as an act of flagrant injustice without justification".17 The proposals of the Viceroy-the reconstitution of the province of Bengal and the transfer of the capital of India to Delhi, received the approval of Lord Crew, the new Secretary of State for India who actually initiated the discussion on the subject. In a durbar held in Delhi, December 1911, His Majesty George V, the King-Emperor, announced "the creation at as early a date as possible of a Governorship-in-Council for the Presidency of Bengal, of a new Lieutenant Governorship in Council administering the areas of Bihar, Chota Nagpur and Orissa and of a Chief Commissionership of Assam. ¹

Assam reverted to a Chief Commissioner's province with a Legislative Council of its own at Shillong. The restoration of status quo by itself was a welcome relief to the Assamese and the local press hailed with joy the decision of the government.¹9 On the otherhand the people of the Surma Valley, particularly those of the district of Sylhet, considered

that "a deep injury and a deep wound" had been inflicted on the Bengali-speaking population by tagging them to Assam having no affinity, whatever, geographical, ethnological and linguistic. 20 In the words of Archdale Earle, the Chief Commissioner of Assam: "They wished to be spurred to higher things by contact with the advanced Bengalis and they lose by being pitted against the backward races of Assam". 21 Inevitably, the district was "convulsed by an unparalled agitation". A public meeting was held at Sylhet on 15 April 1912 under the presidentship of Syed Abdul Majid, President of the Anjuman-I-Islamia, demanding its separation from Assam. 22 In its support, a meeting of the Muslim Association in Dacca under the presidency of Nawab Samsul Huda, passed resolutions recommending amalgation of Sylhet with Bengal. Protesting against the measure, a memorial was submitted to Lord Hardinge, the Viceroy of India, which was signed by all the members of the Legislative Council, Hindus and Muslims, Zamindars and other influential people of the district."

Before long, the attitude of a substantial section of the Muslims underwent a change and they started supporting retention of Sylhet in Assam. They felt that they were backward and were likely to receive more attention from the Assam

Sylhet which was a part of Bengal even during the Mughal rule was transferred to Assam on the reconstitution of the province in 1874 The people of Sylhet felt that a great wrong had been done to them by tagging them to an economically, politically and culturally backward province like Assam. The demand for reunion which they made in a memorial to Lord Northbrooke on 10 Angust 1874, was rejected by the government, but they were assured that they would continue to obtain the benefits of legal institutions of Bengal as well as the Bengal Land Revenue Regulations.

administration than from Bengal government.* Syed Abdul Majid, hitherto a staunch supporter of reunion, in his telegram of August informed the Viceroy that "over 15,000 Muslims meeting assembled yesterday representating the entire Muslim population, Sylhet district, earnestly pray retention of Sylhet in Assam". Even the small number of Muslims then supporting the Hindus, the Chief Commissioner remarked, "is likely to become still smaller if, as it seems probable, the formation of a provincial branch of All India Muslim League is decided upon". 25
From the very beginning the authorities were determined not to yield to the demand of the separationist for reasons economic and political. In the opinion of the official circles Sylhet was occupying a "predominant position", it had prospered exceedingly,f its administration was placed on "a sound footing" and that "there was no guarantee that Sylhet would enjoy the same privilege under Bengal administration".20 Any modification in existing boundaries, it was feared, would
* In the special session of the Assam Legislative Council in July 1926, Maulavi Dewan Wasil Choudhury explained that the separation would deprive the people of Sylhet free Vernacular education which was not in vogue in Bengal and the Sylhet people would be required to pay about Rs. 1,25,000 as tax in the shape of school fees for vernacular education. Moreover, the chowkiduri tax will have to be paid by them at an enhanced rate and the country boats would be taxed touching inostly the pockets of the poor Namasudras, Patnies and Mahimallas. Above all, the introduction of Bengal Tenancy Act could prove ruinous both to land holders and ryots of Sylhet.

The fact that Sylhet was enjoying a better position vis a vis the districts of Assam Valley was corroborated by Kamini Kumar Chanda in the floor of the Assam Legislative Council while demanding the extension of jury system to Sylhet. In support of it, he quoted figures to show that in the field of education, trade and industry the total figures of all Assam Valley districts were equal to the figures of Sylhet.

adversely affect the Muslims who were in the majority and the tea-planting community that made significant contribution to the economic development of the district. "The interests of the planters in these two districts (Sylhet and Cachar) are every way identical and the severance of ylhet would react most injuriously on the Cachar planters."27 Above all, the separation of Sylhet would open the floodgate for similar secessionist movement of the plains of Cachar, Lushai hills and even of Goalpara, upsetting existing arrangements and destroying Hindu-Muslim ratio in the population of Bengal, which Hardinges' government was not prepared to concede.28 "In the newly constituted province of Bengal, the Muhammedans must remain in a position of approximate numerical equality with, or possibly of small superiority over the Hindus."29 The Chief Commissioner was advised by the Viceroy to tell the agitators that "the Government of India have no intention of making any modification in the boundaries of the province of Assam."*
Notwithstanding the discontentment of a section of the Bengali-speaking population of the Surma Valley, Assam was forging ahead as a separate province with a Council of her own from 1 April 1912.. In the reconstituted council the government was in the majority having fourteen nominated members in a house of twenty-five. Of the leading members mention may be made of Kamini Kumar Chanda, Manik Chandra Baruah, Padmanath Gohain Baruah, Tarun Ram Phookun, Ghanashyam Baruah, Radha Binode Das, Muhammad Saadullah

and Raja Probhat Chandra Baruah. Although Councillors like Manik Chandra Baruah were vigilant in safeguarding the legitimate interest of the Assamese and not unoften pressed for the resolutions passed by the Assam Association, they never failed or faltered to uphold the interest of the people as a whole. The attention of the Councillors was drawn early to the workings of the self-governing institutions. Local selfgovernment in those days was only in name. The Local Boards in particular were dominated by the government officials and the tea-planters; and the Chairman of these bodies was invariably a high district official. The representation in the Local Board was apparently vitiated by utter neglect of the interest of the rate-payers. The Councillors were unanimous in their demand for reform and reorganisation of the existing Boards on the line of the Government of India's resolution of May 1882. Manik Chandra Baruah who represented the Local Boards and later the Municipalities urged that there should be a well-understood principle of allotment of seats in proportion to the payment of local rates.30 Padmanath Gohain Baruah criticised the policy of the government in giving undue representation to the planters in the Local Boards, and he argued that their interest in the Local Boards was not SO "universal" as those of the native population." "In matters of education, sanitation, water-supply, etc. . . . the interest of the industry (tea industry) is almost nil. Their interest is confined more or less entirely to matter of communication, and in that branch, the rate-payers are equally interested." 32 When the Bill for Local Self-Government was debated on the floor of the Council on 10 November 1914, non-official members in a body supported the amendment moved by Kamini Kumar Chanda that the Boards be given the power of electing their Chairman. "It will be taking life of these bodies" remarked Tarun Ram Phookun, "if we are to restrict

their powers as regards the appointment of a non-official Chairman".33 The amendment was ultimately lost and rejected. The support of the European members and the teaplanters enabled the government to declare that it was not prepared to accept the payment of local rates as the sole criterion in the matter of representation in such bodies.³4

Excise and grazing tax also had been the target of attack of the Assamese members and they had the support of the public, particularly of the Assam Association.35 In the Brahmaputra Valley, the universal consumption of opium had so much of demoralising effect that it was generally felt that the fate of the Assamese people would be sealed unless this habit was stopped. In spite of growing public opinion, government was neither prepared to welcome any measure seeking prohibition nor to relinquish any part of its revenue on this account on one plea or another. It satisfied itself in raising the rates of government opium and reducing the number of licenses for retail sales which had little effect in eradicating the evil. So the demand for prohibition was emphatic from local members in the Council. Pleading for total prohibition in his budget speech of 1919, Phanidhar Chaliha pronounced "if opium trade is retained the Assamese race will be almost extinct".36 When he characterised the traffic in opium as "tainted money", there was a great uproar in the Treasury Benches and N. D. Beatson Bell, the President of the Council, tauntingly asked him to return the "tainted money" which he had received as pay and allowances since his appointment as a government servant and also as a pensioner.37 The castigation of an honourable member of the Council by no less a person than its President was an insult not only to the honour of Chaliha but to other members of the Council. Inevitably

the incident had its repurcussions both within and outside the country.38

This was
buffalo and annas six on other horned-cattle.3⁹ construed not only as a taxation, directly and indirectly, on a vitally important article of food, namely milk, but also a "repression" on the growth of cattle which form the "life and soul of agriculture" in an agricultural country like Assam. What was worse, defaulters were heavily fined and criminally prosecuted for non-payment on due dates. The gradual enhancement of rates and the oppressive manner of their collection, naturally, raised a storm of protest both in the press and the platform. The Assam Association in its session at Gauhati in 1916 strongly urged the reduction of the rate and amendment of the rules of its assessment.4⁰ Phanidhar Chaliha and Chanashyam Baruah demanded in the Council total abolition of this "oppressive, hateful and abominable tax". Supporting the resolution Saadullah described the tax as "not only dangerous but obnoxious to the community".41 Despite protests within and outside the Council, the government remained ummoved; it expressed its unwillingness to forego the amount of revenue under this head.
When the Morley-Minto reforms opened the problem of the minorities in India, it was but natural that members belonging to these communities would plead for their special needs and requirements in the Council. "It is of course my duty" candidly expressed Padmanath Gohain Baruah, a representative of the Ahoms, "to further or protect the interests of

my community, but I yield to none in my endeavours to protect and uphold the interests of my country and countrymen".4 While deprecating the predominance of the official elements in the Local Boards, Muhammad Saadullah demanded communal representation of the Muslims in these bodies. "The Muhammedan community is so scattered in Assam proper" said Saadullah, "that we can hardly expect to be represented if our Hindu brethren choose to control us".4

The debates and discussions in the Councils, whether of Eastern Bengal and Assam, or of the province of Assam were mere "pious wishes" of the members who had little or no power to carry these out. Under the new Act, the Councils had been subordinated to the executive and were virtually reduced to the position of advisory bodies. The members could not veto on any item of expenditure proposed or tax levied. The official members were supposed to give support to the government in carrying out any measure or in voting down a non-official member's resolution. The implementation of a non-official resolution was dependent on the sweet will of the government. As a result power and responsibilities of legislators were greatly circumscribed. "It is of the utmost importance" remarked Sita Nath Ray in the Eastern Bengal and Assam Council, "both in the interest of the government and the governed... that all the Councils should be reformed and enlarged and a potential and substantial voice allowed to the people in the legislation and in the management of the finances of their own country. The tax-payer like the man who pays the piper should have a voice in the tune. Even a government nominated member of the Assam Legislative Council Muhammad Saadullah expressed his remorse at the way in which the members of the Council were treated by the executive. The Councillors were not only denied the right of becoming the authors of the budget, but they had

Snatching away of such right from people's representatives, Saadullah was constrained to remark, put the Councils to shame.45 Radha Binode Das expressed his embarrassment with his position as a Councillor sitting in the house "with the avowed object of talking and of doing little".4

On the outbreak of the first World War India was declared a belligerent. The Congress led by the Moderates had pledged its all out support and co-operation to war efforts by Britain in the hope of radical changes in the political situation after the war which would strengthen its demand for self-government. At this juncture, even Tilak the Extremist leader declared that "it is the duty of every Indian, be he great or small, rich or poor, to support and assist His Majesty's Government to the best of his ability". But the terrorists who had gone underground attempted to wrest freedom from British rule by armed revolt by the Indian army and with the help of powers in enmity with Britain. Indian revolutionaries made arrangements for securing supplies of arms and money from abroad and organisations were set up in London, Paris and San Francisco for the purpose. For the punishment and suppression of revolutionary activities Imperial Legislative Council hurriedly passed the Defence of India Act, 1915. It authorised the Local governments in supersession of the Criminal Law to institute summary trials of "Political suspects" by Special Tribunals with powers to inflict sentences of death and transportation for life and their judgment was to be "final and conclusive". During 1915-16, carrying "a price of Rs. 20,000 over his head", Jadu Gopal Mukherjee, an outstanding revolutionary, eluding the vigilance of police kept up his activities from Assam.f In 1917, Jadu Gopal with his

associates made an attempt to open out a route to China from their "shelters" in the Assam-Bhutan border wherein revolvers, guns and other lethal weapons were collected; but on account of lack of funds and division in the party, the project had ultimately to be abandoned.18 Several revolutionaries fell into the hands of the police, though some of them remained at large. On 18-19 January 1918, after armed clashes with the police, Nalini Ghose and some other revolutionaries, who had been hiding at Fancy Bazar and Athgaon in Gauhati, were arrested and later tried by Special Commissions under the Defence of India Act. Nalini Ghose was sentenced to seven years' imprisonment and four others to three years' confinement in jail under the Arms Act.¹9

The war had accelerated the pace of constitutional development in India. The utterances made by the English Statesmen that they were waging a war "to make the world safe for democracy" and the declaration of Woodrow Wilson, the President of the U.S.A., that "we fight for liberty, the selfdetermination and the undictated development of the peoples", could not but raise similar hopes in the minds of the Indians. In the post-war period "if the Poles and the Alsatians and the Danes were to be left free to determine their own policy how could India be refused what the conscience of the world had conceded to the smaller European nations".50 The general

feeling was that great constitutional changes were in the offing and that the ground must be prepared to that end. In September 1916, nineteen members of the Imperial Legislative Council drafted a memorandum proposing a scheme of government "acceptable to the people because it is responsible to them". About this time Mrs Annie Besant and Tilak, since released from imprisonment, started Home Rule Movement independently to pressurise British public opinion by intense agitation for granting self-government to India. The death of moderate leaders Gopal Krishna Gokhale and Pheroz Shah Mehta already removed the obstacle for the reunion of the Extremists and the Moderates since the Surat Split in 1907. To crown all in the Congress-League accord and the Lucknow Pact (December 1916) the leaders of both the parties formulated a scheme of government demanding equal status in the Empire with the self-governing dominions.
The unity in the rank of Congressmen, Congress-League accord, the announcement of President Wilson, the successes of the Russian revolution and the popular recognition of the Indian revolutionaries created a favourable political climate for post-war reforms in India. British Statesmen realised that any postponment of the decision of the Indian problem would hamper in the successful prosecution of the war and hence there followed the declaration of E. S. Montagu, the Secretary of State for India, on 20 August 1917, that the policy of His Majesty's government in India
is that of the increasing association of Indians in every branch of administration and the gradual development of self-governing institutions with a view to the progressive realisation of the responsible Government in India as an integral part of the British Empirc.51
The historic announcement made by the Secretary of State was hailed by the Moderates as the "Magna Charta of India", but the Extremists regarded it as "unsatisfactory both

in language and substance". As a compromise the Congress in its Calcutta Session (1917) passed the following resolution :
215
This congress expresses its grateful satisfaction over the pronouncement made by His Majesty's Secretary of State for India on behalf of the Imperial Government and its object is the establishment of responsible government in India.
This Congress strongly urges the necessity for immediate enactment of a Parliamentary Statute providing for the establishment of Responsible Government in India, the full measure to be attained within a time limit to be fixed in the Statute itself at an carly date.
This Congress is emphatically of opinion that the Congress-League scheme of reforms ought to be immediately introduced by the Statute as the first step in the process.
To make a personal study of the Indian political situation Montagu arrived in India on 10 December 1917. During his stay here for six months, accompanied by Chelmsford, the Viceroy of India, Montagu visited different parts of the country and received a series of deputations from political parties including a joint delegation of the Congress and the Muslim League. The report, jointly signed by Montagu and Chelmsford, containing the proposed reforms being published in July 1918 was received with mixed feelings by the Indians. Not only did the demand for self-government remain a far cry, political concessions proposed to be given to the Indians were hedged by certain limitations. The bonafidés of the bureaucrats was also greatly doubted when in the meantime a committee under Justice Sydney Rowlatt drafted a set of rules to replace the Defence of India Act which would be inoperative on the termination of the World War. Nevertheless, Moderates like Surendra Nath Banerjea welcomed the scheme as a great political advance, but Tilak regarded it as "entirely unacceptable". Annie Besant denounced the reforms as "unworthy of England to offer and unworthy of India to accept". A special session of the Congress held at Bombay in August 1918, condemned the Montagu scheme as "disappointing and unsatisfactory" and asserted that "the people of India are fit for self-government", and declared that "nothing less

than self-government within the Empire can satisfy the Indian people". This was not only reaffirmed at the Delhi session of the Congress in December 1918, but a new clause was added to the effect that "so far as provinces are concerned, full responsible government should be granted at once, and that no part of British India should be excluded from the benefit of the proposed constitutional reforms . . .".
MORLEY-MINTO REFORMS AND ASSAM
The Assam Association in its session at Goalpara on 27-29 December 1918, emphatically demanded self-government for India and the abolition of the repressive laws envisaged in the Rowlatt Bills and the Arms Act.52 In his presidential address Tarun Ram Phookun regretted that the Montagu-Chelmsford Scheme of Reforms had fallen short of the expectation raised by the announcement made by His Majesty's Government. Commenting on the attitude of the English officers, English traders and other die-hards who used to say that India was not fit for' self-government, Phookun argued that one cannot learn swimming without plunging into water :
If India is not fit for self-government even after a century and half of British Rule, who is responsible for this? It is the British Rule which is to blame. The British officials who came from England to rule here know neither the language nor manners and customs of the country and if they can manage to rule well why not educated Indians who know the country so well? Indians
to-day are much better fitted for self-government than the Canadians when self-government was given to Canada.53
The Montford Reforms left it ambiguous whether or not Assam would be included in the reform scheme. It was suggested in para 199 of the Report that "schedules" of the Scheduled District of the Act might form the criterion for exclusion of Assam from the scheme. The Assam Association had to send a strong delegation* to Calcutta to present before

Montagu, Assam's case when it found that the Chief Commissioner and the European community in a body stood opposed to Assam's inclusion in the proposed reforms as a province at par with the other advanced provinces of India. Sir Beatson Bell, the Chief Commissioner, suggested that Assam should be treated separately on account of her peculiar geographical position and the heterogenous character of the population including a fairly large number of Europeans in plantation and mining areas. He was in favour of treating her like Burma or North-West Frontier Province or for postponing the operation of the new scheme until the experiment had been tested elsewhere. He, of course, desired the continuance of the existing Legislative Council with the addition of an Advisory Council with the Chief Commissioner "constituted on a liberal basis".54 The Surma Valley branch of the Indian Tea Association had gone to the extent of demanding exclusion of Assam from the reform scheme saying that there was no "intelligentsia” in Assam. It alleged that the number of people who could read a voting paper was so small that direct representation given to them would be a farce.55 The representatives of the European community also shared the same view and they demanded that in the event of Assam's inclusion in the scheme there should be adequate representation for their community and also for the planters in the Councils both at the centre and the province.56 Several organisations and groups submitted their views from their sectional or communal interests. Surma Valley Muhammedan Association, Mahishya Samiti of Sunamganj, Ahom Association and Assam Muhammedan Association pressed their respective claims for communal representation in case Assam was included in the new

scheme. Surma Valley Peoples Association demanded incorporation of Sylhet district into Bengal.57
The position of Assam Association, which alone stood for the province as a whole, became all the more embarrassing when Prabhat Chandra Baruah, the first President of the Association, espoused the cause of Zamindari Association, Goalpara, who demanded amalgamation of his district with Bengal.58 In view of these fissiparous tendencies and the united front offered by the European group, the prospect of Assam being brought within the purview of the reform scheme became extremely bleak. It was indeed a big challenge to the Assam Association. In its meeting at Goalpara, in the teeth of opposition of a section of its members, the Association stoutly and successfully opposed the secessionists and deprecated the move of the Chief Commissioner and European tea-planters to keep Assam beyond the pale of forthcoming reforms.59 In a lengthy memorial to the Secretary of State, Ghanashyam Baruah, the General Secretary, refuting all the points raised by Beatson Bell stated lucidly the rights and claims of Assam to be included in the proposed reforms. Earlier in a meeting at Jorhat, the Association decided to send a one-man delegation in the person of Nabin Chandra Bardoloi, an active member of the Association, to represent Assam's case before the Parliamentary Committee in Calcutta.6⁰ In his evidence, both oral and written, Bardoloi refuted the arguments of the Chief Commissioner, the Europeans and other communal groups and associations. He asserted that Assam was much more favourably situated for representative government than any other province of India. Every student of Assam History was well aware, he pointed out, that the nobles and the nine Councillors under the former government elected kings and

Even now every village containing several castes is nothing but a representative unit, the village namghar being the common meeting place ...

On 29 May 1919, the proposed Bill was introduced in the British Parliament and a Select Committee of both the Houses under the Chairmanship of Lord Selborne was appointed to scrutinise the bill and to make suggestions wherever necessary. This had enabled the Indian leaders to present their respective points of view in London for consideration by the Parliamentary Committee. The Assam Association also decided to send a two-men delegation consisting of Nabin Chandra Bardoloi and Prasanna Kumar Baruah."
Difficulties had to be faced by the delegation one after another from the very beginning. "Assam then was a poor country", deplores a member of the delegation, "and the political consciousness of the people was still in the oblivion and the awakening of the danger (which) then loomed over the firmament of Assam (was) confined to a few top-ranking intelligentsia whose number could be counted on fingers".63 The untiring efforts of Chandra Nath Sarmah, the Assistant Secretary of the Association, succeeded in collecting an amount of rupees four thousand-sufficient only for one member of the delegation. Luckily, Prasanna Kumar Baruah, an Assamese planter and a member of the Association, voluntered to go of his own. When the delegation reported its arrival

mission, they were taken aback to learn that their evidence would be taken on the same afternoon. Yet the delegation mustered courage and prepared for the "ordeal". At the appointed hour like "a pair of goats for sacrifice" when the members appeared before the Commission, they were told by E. S. Montagu, the Secretary of State, that the representation sent in advance by the Association being "wrongly addressed" was misplaced. The delegation was given the option of oral evidence forthwith or to postpone it till October next when the session would reopen after the recess. 61 "This was a bolt from the blue", writes Prasanna Baruah, "and our faces at once elongated, with heart throbs not knowing what to do as the memorial submitted by Assam Association was our sheet anchor The delegation rose up to the occasion and with "courage and confidence" accepted the first alternative. In his evidence lasting for quarter of an hour with irrefutable arguments Bardoloi pleaded for the inclusion of Assam in the reform scheme. After making a survey of the social, political and economic condition of Assam, he remarked that a "planters Rai actually dominating in every field of administration and at their hands even respected Assamese were subjected to utmost humiliation. Bardoloi never failed to refer to the shabby treatment that had been meted out to Phanidhar Chaliha by the Chief Commissioner in the floor of the Council which made the members "look at each other with awry faces".05

In London, the members of the delegation contacted Indian Political leaders like Bal Gangadhar Tilak, Bipin Chandra Pal, Tej Bahadur Sapru, Sankaran Nayar and Sarojini Naidu and attended meetings and receptions organised by the British Congress Party and Labour Party which had enabled them to win their sympathy and support to the legitimate demands of Assam. When the delegation met Montagu at his office after its evidence, the members were indirectly told that they had won the case, but it must be supported by a representation with strong and valid grounds; and this the delegation did successfully on the reopening of the session. Admittedly, the personal endeavours made by the members of the delegation and the persistent attempts of the Assam Association had enabled Assam to occupy her rightful place as a major province in the new political set-up.

<content>CHAPTER TWELVE
Gathering of the Storm
On the outbreak of the World War I when the Indian National Congress at Madras (1914) resolved "to stand by the Empire at all hazards and at all costs", the people of Assam expressed their unstinted loyalty to the government at this critical moment. The members of the Assam Legislative Council, both European and the Indian, pledged wholehearted support to the British Government in the prosecution of the war.¹ In his last speech in the Council appealing to his countrymen to join the war efforts of Britain Manik Chandra Baruah said : "Great Britain and India have a common cause".2 Tarun Ram Phookun expressed his profound satisfaction that the people of Assam had been able to make much contribution to the war and that many Assamese youngmen had been fighting shoulder to shoulder with their counterparts of other states in the war front. To secure best possible results in recruitment he suggested to the government to entrust the task to officers of responsibility and to open up a training centre in Assam for the Indian Defence Forces."
From its cadre the Assam administration spared 174 officers for military duty. Invaluable services had been rendered by non-official members of the Assam Valley Light Horse and the Surma Valley Light Horse; 168 of them joined the Indian Army Reserved Officers and seventy nine in regular forces while thirty one served with Labour Corps. In all 3232 officers and men were contributed. A double Company

of Assamese men was formed and a few youngmen joined the Bengal Regiment and 239 recruits joined the Royal Artillery. From Sylhet, in addition to a number of men as Marine ratings, a Labour Corps of about one thousand was sent to Mesopotamia and in all Sylhet supplied about 2,600 combatants and non-combatants. In terms of money it was ascertained that rupees twenty five thousand was subscribed by this province as war loan and an amount estimated at nine lakhs contributed as war charities. In addition, donations for war purposes amounting to rupees fiftyfive thousand and goods and materials worth rupees twenty thousand were collected from the province.5

India rendered all through the war utmost help to war efforts of Great Britain in terms of men, money and materials. Consequently her military expenditure swelled up several times at the cost of the productive and nation building projects. Besides severe cuts under the head Education and Public Works, capital expenditure on Railways and Irrigation dwindled from fourteen to three millions. Above all when the chances of receiving Imperial grants both recurring and non-recurring became remote, the provincial budgets showed heavy deficits. In Assam economic consequences had been felt gradually after 1915-16 when stringency in the public expenditure was resorted to in response to the Imperial orders. Since then although large amounts were spent in "urgent and imperative" needs and in items like relief measures, no money could be spared for development works to improve material condition of the ryots or to create employment opportunities to ever increasing educated youths of the province.

remarked: "To have a budget discussion when there is very little or no money is, to my mind, like acting Hamlet without Hamlet himself'."
The war had "disturbed the equilibrium of the commercial world".10 Imported commodities like salt, cloths and kerosene oil became scarce and their prices rose several times. This was aggravated by the speculating activities of the unscrupulous merchants who raised the prices not only of articles of rare use or those used by the rich but even of the vital necessities of the rich as well as of the poor.¹1 After Armistice prices fell appreciably when the merchants released their hoarded stock fearing heavy losses with the return of nomalcy and the importation of foreign goods; but when the situation remained unaltered prices were raised to the highest limit. ¹2 The cost of salt went up more than double while that of cloth four times; even the coarsest possible cloth was sold in the market at double the rate of the finest stuff in pre-war times.¹3 Inevitably towards the end of 1919 price of rice, the staple food, rosc alarmingly; it was sold in the plains districts at four to five seers a rupee although double the quantity could be had with the same amount only a year before.

The highest price to the extent of twelve rupees a maund was recorded in certain areas of the Surma Valley.¹

The rise in prices of essential commodities affected the rich as well the poor. The miseries of the agricultural ryots were aggravated by natural calamities-floods, kala-azar and cattle mortality. The devastating floods in both the Brahmaputra and the Surma Valley during 1915-16 compelled three-fourths of the ryots to depend entirely on government's gratuitous relief and loans; and to repay these not invariably the poverty striken ryots had to borrow money from village mahajans at ruinous interests. 15 The condition of the ill-paid clerical staff and school teachers was no less deplorable.16 The ministerial officers of the Shillong Secretariat appealed for relief to the Chief Comissioner, but the latter while expressing all sympathy for their hardship, regretted his inability to concede to their demands since not the government employees of Shillong alone, but also of the entire province suffered from price rise and for whom it was not possible on the part of the government to provide necessary compensation. In protest the employees of the Government Press resorted to a strike which suspended the publication of the Assam Gazette for about a month. 18 A similar strike, on the otherhand, of the employces of the Dibru-Sadiya Railways secured for them an increase in wages to a certain limit. 19

GATHERING OF THE STORM
Scarcity of food stuff and other necessaries gave rise to economic crimes like theft and burglary in many places of both the valleys." In 1919 salt and cloths were looted from Goalpara and similar reports of bazar looting came from Upper Assam and several areas of the district of Cachar. On 27 September 1920, labourers of the Hukanjuri tea garden of the Assam Frontier Tea Company raided a weekly hat at Borhapjan and in an affray several traders and labourers were injured. Such "economic crimes" in the words of a member of the Assam Legislative Council, would not have been committed by "an essentially peace-loving people like ours unless driven to the course from sheer necessity".22 Phanidhar Chaliha in his speech in the Council on 13 March 1918, urged upon the government either to open State or Municipal depots or take steps in the line of Bombay and the Punjab governments for the distribution of salt, cloth and other essential commodities at reasonable prices.23 Suggestions of similar nature were made by several members of the Council to bring down the price for alleviating the distress of the people. In response to the demand, both within the Council and without, the Government of Assam not only granted loans and gratuitous reliefs but also suspended collection of land revenue in flood-affected areas during the period 1915-17.24 In March 1918, the retail price of salt in the Assam Valley was fixed by a notification and similar measures followed soon in the

As stated above endeavours had been made by the government to relieve the distress of the ryots, but the authorities were rather indifferent so far as the immigrant labourers were concerned. With the pressing demand for labour in the ever expanding tea-plantations there was a steady increase in immigrant population which was estimated at over a million by 1911, forming about eighty per cent of the total wage earners of the province.29 The Arkatis or recruiters generally visited poverty-striken and famine-affected labour districts all over India and held out a rosy picture before the unwilling labourers and assuring them handsome wages in the tea districts of Assam.30 Their problem started soon after their arrival in Assam when they were placed under Managers invariably fresh from England who were totally ignorant of

their nature, language, customs and usages. Misunderstanding between the two was inevitable; but this could have been minimised to some extent had there been effective supervision on the part of the government. Over burdened as they were with multifarious duties, neither the district officers nor even their subordinates could have a close watch over the affairs of so many gardens and consequently the immigrants were left entirely at the tender mercies of the Managers. Armed with statutory powers the latter not only apprehended the labourers without warrant but kept them confined for days together subjecting them even to corporal punishments of various kinds. Even on flimsy grounds they were brought blind-fold to the Manager's bungalow and flogged mercilessly after tying to a post. Instances were not rare when salt was rubbed over the fresh cane-cuts. To lodge a complaint against a tyrannous Manager was out of the question, and even if one succeeded, the close intimacy between the garden and district authorities made it difficult for the aggrieved to have an impartial decision on his case. Small wonder that the labourers occasionally took law into their own hands. From 1882 to 1893, the labourers unlawfully assembled 580 times, murdered 31 individuals, assaulted in no less than 505 cases causing even grievous injuries in large numbers.33

Since the sixties of the last century commissions had been set up by the government, one after another, to enquire into the problem of the labourers and to some extent their grievances had also been remedied, but the question of a

living wage remained unsettled. The lack of bargaining power on the part of the labourers in the absence of Trade Unions enabled the employers to dictate any terms; and the general tendency was to exact the maximum of works by payment of minimum wages. In spite of subsidiary sources of income,* it was extremely difficult for the labourers to make both ends meet and their condition became all the more deplorable with rise in prices of rice and other necessaries. Even in the eighties a husband and wife labouring together all the year round scarcely succeeded in saving some amount that would enable the women to stay for some months at home after her confinement to look after her infant child.34 To their cause, apparently, the government was sympathetic, but pressurised by influential vested interests it had to enact plantation laws exclusively in the interest of the employers. No wonder therefore there was no alteration in the minimum wage in 1901 from that which was fixed up thirtyfive years earlier in 1865.35
229
During 1913-19, in spite of abnormal rise in the cost of living in the tea-gardens, the wages paid to the labourers in pre-war times remained unaltered." In the Dibrugarh Subdivision, for instance, the average wage earned by a labourer in 1911-2 was Rs. 10-10-9 P., and in 1918-9 it stood at Rs. 10-8-1 P.37 The financial condition of the gardens, European ones in particular, continued to be sound which is borne out by their larger recruitment of labourers in the post-war period and payment of pre-war, if not higher, dividends to their

share holders. The planters, the majority of them, made no attempt to consider the problem of the labourers sympathetically or to remedy their legitimate grievances. Matters, inevitably, took their own course and the aggrieved labouring population in the ea areas gave vent to their anti-British feelings at some places by strikes and demonstrations.39 The scattered unrest amongst immigrant labourers was the indication of the great storm that was ahead which neither the planters nor those at the helm of affairs of the state could ever foresee and which the nationalists never failed to take full advantage of in their war against the alien government.¹0
The talk of constitutional reform intensified the demand for separation of Sylhet and even of Goalpara which had embittered the feelings between the peoples of the two valleys, nay within the valley of the Brahmaputra itself. The leaders of the Surma Valley were apprehensive of the fact that in case of the implementation of Reform scheme Assam had no chance like Bengal of becoming a major province with a Governor-in Council.11 The establishment of a University in Assam, it was feared, would seriously affect the academic life of the Bengalis of the Surma Valley. The spirit of provincialism, in fact, ran high in both the valleys. In the Indian Legislative Council on 6 February 1918, Kamini Kumar Chanda raised the question of amalgamation of Sylhet with Bengal

Thus on 6 September 1920, at Hansara, a garden of the Doomdooma Tea Company labourerers went to strike. On the 15th, at Raidang they refused to work and the Jamadar and two European Assistants were assaulted. Similar outbreak occurred at Pabhojan and Dhoedaam.
40 Tracing the causes of the labour unrest in the twenties to "economic and political conditions", Assam Labour Enquiry Committee (1921-2) remarks that “undoubtedly the existence of economic grievances render coolies more ready to listen to the exhortation and incitements of non-cooperators and other agitators."

in the form of a resolution with the remark that "the provincial boundaries were not made on broad and comprehensive lines and with a view to giving satisfaction to all".42 The resolution was lost but the movement for separation gathered strength with the formation of Sylhet-Bengal Re-union League which decided to wait upon the Viceroy who was then expected to visit Assam. At a public meeting on 29 October 1919 at Sylhet, Chanda appealed to the people of Sylhet to continue their agitation till the object was attained. Supporting the cause, Abdul Karim, a member of the Bengal Legislative Council said that the artificial relation between Assam and Sylhet for long fortyfive years failed to produce unity between the two peoples. At the end, the meeting unanimously passed a resolution to the effect that "to give the people of Sylhet a fair chance of working under any liberal scheme of reforms, it is absolutely necessary to transfer the district to Bengal with which Sylhet is indissolubly bound up by ties of race, language, manners, customs, history and culture".43

As a corollary to it, the Bengali-speaking population of Goalpara, mostly the intelligentsia, expressed their desire for union with Bengal. The movement had started, in fact, in 1912, when number of zamindars of Goalpara urged on Archdale Earle, the separation of the district in case Sylhet was to be transferred to Bengal. To the Chief Commissioner the demand was quite natural, but "very undesirable" from the point of view of the zamındars and the administration of Assam". "A majority of the people of Goalpara sub-division", he explained, "are Assamese or speak Assamese, while in the Dhubri sub-division there is a minority who are in similar case. On this ground alone, it is impossible to contemplate separating this district from Assam". The agitation took a

definite shape when a meeting of the secessionists was held on 15 December 1918, under the auspices of the Goalpara Association.45 Apprehending that Assam would not be brought under the reform scheme the meeting resolved that "the district of Goalpara mainly identical in race, language, social customs and the system of lands with Rangpur, Jalpaiguri and Cooch Behar ... be placed under the same laws and administration with the district of Rangpur and Jalpaiguri". It was also decided that the resolution be placed in the ensuing meeting of the Assam Association scheduled to be held at Goalpara towards the end of the same month. Finally, it made a further demand by a separate resolution that "at the time of application of the expected Montagu-Chelmsford reforms to the plains districts of Assam Valley all the districts of the Assam Valley be placed under the Governor of Bengal".46
The Assamese public, by and large, were sympathetic to the aspirations of the people of Sylhet. To many, separation of Sylhet would be a blessing in disguise; for whenever the Assamese made a demand for a University or a High Court, there invariably followed a counter claim for a similar institution for the other valley.47 The Assamese intelligentsia, on the otherhand, had a different view on the Goalpara issue; the district was considered by them as an integral part of Assam.

47 Moving the resolution on the transfer of Sylhet at the session of the Assam Legislative Council, in July 1926, Sadananda Dowerah said that a reading of the proceedings of the earlier Council would reveal that the whole affair had been a "sickening record of rivalry" of the claims of the two valleys. "If there is question whether a certain institution be established in the province" Dowerah continued, "the question becomes where it is to be located Sylhet or Gauhati and so on, and so we have had to drop thus all questions of this nature. If Sylhet continues with us what is the result? We shall have to carry on the same policy of drift With Sylhet in Assam there will be no policy and unless there is a fixed policy there cannot be any progress". Nehru Museum and Library, Op.cit.

<content>Successful Opposition of Assam Association
The situation however took a new turn in 1919, when discussions were in progress on the proposed Montagu-Chelmsford Reforms. Thereafter, Assamese leaders strongly opposed any disintegration whether of Goalpara or Sylhet; they feared that it would adversely affect Assam's status in the new administrative set-up.48

The separatist movement became a life and death question which the Assam Association was called upon to tackle when it met under the presidentship of Tarun Ram Phookun at Goalpara on 27-29 December 1918. The feeling was then running so high between the Assamese and local Bengalis that the latter not only boycotted the reception of the President-elect on his arrival, but withheld cooperation to the organisers of the conference. In fact almost all Bengali-speaking members had already severed their connection with the Assam Association. In his opening address Phookun emphatically declared that "this (Goalpara) district should never be taken away from Assam, if necessary the whole of Assam might be united with Bengal". He enquired of the public "if we are footballs that we should be kicked from one place to another (i.e. from Assam to Bengal, and then from Bengal to Assam and so on).50 Chandradhar Baruah, a member of the Assam Delegation to Calcutta, deprecated the rumours spread by interested parties that Assam's geographical boundaries would be reduced and in support of this he quoted the statement made by the Secretary of State that "any redistribution of territory was not under contemplation".51 Despite opposition of a minority, a resolution was moved from the chair and carried protesting vehemently against the movement for the transfer of Goalpara and Sylhet to Bengal on the ground that this was not the wish of the bulk of the people. The secessionist movements petered away on the indifference of the Government of India to any

redistribution of territory or modification of the boundary of Assam on the eve of the reforms.
On the basis of the Montagu-Chelmsford Report, the Government of India Act, 1919, was passed in December the same year. It envisaged a two fold division or dyarchy of provincial administration under which partial responsibility was granted in "transferred" subjects, but ultimate responsibility rested with the executive on the "reserved" subjects. No fundamental change was introduced in the central government and the Government of India continued to be responsible to the British Parliament through the Secretary of State. Moderates hailed the reforms as 'a definite and substantial step" towards Responsible Government and even Nationalist Tilak wanted to work it in a spirit of "Responsive Co-operation". Pleading its acceptance M. K. Gandhi wrote in the Young India :
&amp;lt;&amp;lt;
The Reform Act coupled with the (Royal) proclamation is an earnest intention of the British people to do justice to India and it ought to remove suspicion on that score our duty therefore is not to subject the Reforms to carping criticisms but to settle down quietly to work so as to make them a success.52
Till then Gandhi had, like the Moderates, implicit faith on the justice and liberalism of the British government. Majority of the Congressmen, on the otherhand, were dissatisfied at the "inadequacy of the reforms" and the "grudging manner in which responsibility and transfer of power was granted in the Act of 1919".5 53 Yet under Gandhi's insistence the congress at Amritsar in December 1919, passed the following resolution :
This congress trusts that, so far as may be possible the people will so work the Reforms as to secure an early establishment of full responsible government, and this Congress offers its thanks to the Rt. Hon. E. S. Montagu for his labours in connection with the Reforms.54

<content>The Khilafat Movement
The attitude of the Indian Muslims, too, underwent a radical change towards the British government. The revocation of Partition of Bengal had already alienated the Indian Muslims from the British. Turkey's aid to Germany in the World War placed the Indian Muslims in an embarrassing situation; for the latter regarded the Ottoman Sultan as the Khalifa or religious head of the Islamic world. British government however secured the adhesion of the Indian Muslims in its own efforts on the assurance that due consideration would be given to Turkey at the end of the war. Even Woodrow Wilson, President of the U.S.A., endorsed the declaration made by British Premier Lloyd George in January 1918, that the Allies were "not fighting to deprive Turkey of the rich and renowned countries of Asia Minor and Thrace which were predominantly Turkish in race". To their utter disappointment, after the Armistice the Muslims found that Thrace was transferred to Greece and the Asiatic possession of Turkey passed under the control of Great Britain and France as Mandated territories. The dismemberment of the Ottoman Empire was considered to be a great betrayal and the cry of a jihad against British perfidy was on the air. The vigorous agitation commonly known as Khilafat movement, started by the Ali BrothersMuhammad and Shoukat-to undo the wrongs done to Turkey received support of M. K. Gandhi who found in it the golden opportunity to unite the two warring communities-the Hindus and the Muslims. A satyagrahi to his core, Gandhi advised the Khilafatists to eschew violence in any form and shape, but to resort to non-violent non-cooperation until the problem of Turkey received a satisfactory solution.
235
The Khilafat movement found a ready response in the heart of the Assamese-both the Hindus and the Muslims. Meetings and demonstrations were held at different parts of the province. On 25 October Khilafat day was observed at some places in Cachar where some Hindus along with their Muslim brethren fasted and offered prayers for the Khilafat and Islam.

the Muslims for the whole day, at a public meeting attended by both the communities, resolutions were passed protesting against the interference of powers over the Caliphate and appealing to the British government to save the Turkish Empire from disintegration and making the authority of the Ottoman Sultan absolute over the holy places of Mecca and Medina.55 In a meeting held at Goalpara attended by the Muslims and the Hindus the British Prime Minister was urged not to sign any treaty stipulation dismembering the Turkish Empire.56 Likewise in a meeting at Munshibazar, Karimganj Sub-division, resolutions were passed demanding that the integrity of Turkey should not be disturbed."
Concession cum repression invariably followed by the government marred the prospects of smooth implementation of the reforms. The Bills which were prepared on the recommendations of the Rowlatt Commission provided inter alia arrest without warrant and summary trial and punishment even on suspicion of offences of a revolutionary character or against the State. Condemning the Bills as "unjust, subversive of all principles of liberty and justice and destructive of elementary rights of an individual", Gandhi told the Viceroy that he would resort to Satyagraha unless the Bills were withdrawn.58 In the Indian Legislative Council, Jinnah warned the government : "it is my duty to tell you that, if these measurcs are passed, you will create in the country from one end to other a discontent and agitation, the like of which you have not witnessed Kamini Kumar Chanda while opposing the Bills remarked that, "to give us reforms and side by side with them and in fact before them these repressive laws ... was

not the way to introduce reforms". He also warned that the passing of these Bills was bound to create considerable agitation all over the country."
Not only did the members of the Indian legislature irrcspective of their party affiliations and ideological differences, oppose the Bills, but protests and demonstrations became a matter of common occurrence all over India. In a meeting held at the (Assam Club) Public Hall, on 16 February 1919. presided over by Tarun Ram Phookun the people of Gauhati by a resolution expressed their deep sense of regret and disappointment at the action of the government in proceeding with the Rowlatt Bills in spite of opposition of the non-official members of the Indian Legislative Council and urged the government to drop the Bills.61 The meeting apprehended that the "expected good effect of the proposed reforms based on the Montagu-Chelmsford report will be nullified by the passing of these repressive measures". The people of Sylhet in their meeting on 19 February presided over by Khan Bahadur Syed Abdul Majid protested against the Bills since it was not the time for the introduction of such measures which will curtail the liberty of the people. The citizens of Dibrugarh emphatically protested against the Bills in a meeting at the Amateur Theatre Hall on 23 February 1919 under the presidentship of Faiznur Ali. The meeting was of the opinion that the Bills would "involve a perpetual suspension of the ordinary principles of evidence and procedure of British courts of justice and one calculated to interfere with the personal rights and liberties of the subjects".

GATHERING OF THE STORM
Despite country-wide opposition the Bills were passed as Anarchical and Revolutionary Crimes Act, 1919 and became effective from 21 March. This "Black Act" and the events which followed brought into prominence M. K. Gandhi who was destined to play the most significant role in India's struggle for freedom with a new weapon Satyagraha. The aim of satyagraha or non-cooperation is the "conversion of the opponent to one's own views by suffering and not by violence". Explaining it Gandhiji says in his autobiography :
It involves self-chosen suffering and humiliation for the resisters. If it is effective, it is so by working on the conscience of those against whom it is being used, sapping their confidence in the exclusive rightness of their case, making their physical strength impotent, and weakening their resolution by insinuating a sense of guilt for the sufferings they have a part in causing.
Failure in his prayers, petitions, and interviews compelled Gandhi to resort to this technique to remove the invidious discriminations and indignities meeted out to the Indians in South Africa. He experimented it with success in 1916 at Champaran, Bihar, against Indigo-planters who subjected the cultivators to ruthless oppression. Gandhi defied the government order when he was asked to quit Bihar. He was arrested, but the case had to be withdrawn and the harrowing tales which Gandhi revealed after his investigation compelled the government to pass necessary legislative measures to ameliorate the condition of the peasantry. Later satyagraha was applied in resolving a dispute between the mill-owners and labourers at Ahmedabad and in effecting a compromise at Kaira between the authorities and peasants over assessment.
As a protest against the Rowlatt Act, Gandhi gave a call for hartal on an all Indía basis and the people readily responded. It was an amazing spectacle on 6 April 1919, when "the whole of India from one end to the other, towns as well as

Jallianwala Bagh Tragedy and its Aftermath
villages, observed the hartal5 In spite of isolated incidents in places like Delhi and Ahmedabad, there was unprecedented enthusiasm of the people and fraternisation between the Muslims and the Hindus which unnerved the authorities. Unable to read the sign of times the government unleashed a "reign of repression" at Lahore, Delhi and Amritsar. The "blackest act" was committed at Amritsar in the afternoon of 13 April 1919, while a meeting was held at an enclosed area known as Jallianwala Bagh. There under the orders of General Michael O'Dwyer the troops fired ceaselessly upon unarmed people until their ammunitions were exhausted and killed 379 and wounded over a thousand. Martial law was then clamped over the whole of Punjab and this was followed by indicriminate rrests, whipping, shooting, hangings and even aerial bombardments. Special tribunals were set up which were
not courts of justice, but instruments for carrying out arbitrary will of an autocrat. Sentences were passed unwarranted by evidence and in flagrant violation of justice. In Amritsar innocent men and women were made to crawl like worms on their bellies.66
67
Even Winston Churchill in the British Parliament called the Jallianwala Bagh massacre as the "greatest blot that has been placed upon it (England) since the days gone by when we burned down Joan of Arc". Naturally a wave of indignation swept all over the country and there was a strong demand for the recall and impeachment of the persons responsible for the horrible atrocity. But the British public and their government "absolved them of the guilt" and "acclaimed them as the saviours of the Empire" The dismemberment of Turkey at the Treaty of Severs (May 1920) despite protests and entreaties of the Islamic world and the whole hearted

GATHERING OF THE STORM
cooperation of Gandhi to the Khilafat cause brought the Muslims and the Hindus still closer in their common struggle for the country's freedom from the foreign rule. At this critical moment, it was indeed unfortunate that Tilak died and his mantle fell on Gandhi who was thenceforth to guide the destinies of the nation. The Indian National Congress at its special session at Calcutta in September 1920 and plenary session at Nagpur resolved on non-cooperation with the government for the redress of Khilafat and Punjab wrongs and the attainment of complete Swaraj. Henceforth "the tide of Indian nationalism took a new turn under the leadership of Mahatma Gandhi and the national movement became a people's movement for the liberty from one end of the country to another".09
Assam had played a significant role in the struggle for freedom which had just begun; but in the earlier stages her political development was rather slow. It would be too much to expect of Assam the same political advancement as that of Bengal which had stolen a march over her in English education by nearly half a century. Till the close of the nineteenth century the progress of education in Assam, higher English education in particular, was hopelessly slow while the problem of communication and transport rendered it extremely difficult for her people to have contacts even with their politically advanced neighbours of Bengal. Above all, the horrors of the Burmese invasions and the depredations made by the neighbouring hill tribes broke down the morale of the peaceloving Assamese to such an extent that they could not contemplate any government other than the British that would ensure them all they wanted-security of life and property. As stated already, even Maniram Dewan, the arch-enemy of the British, at the time, not only welcomed but sincerely desired Pax-Britannica till the end of Kalpa (i.e. 4,320,000,000 years). To the early English educated Assamese British rule was a Divine dispensation and freedom of the country from 69 Dutta, K. K., Freedom Movement in Bihar, i, p. 291.

<content>Nationalist Movement in Assam: Its beginnings
the British was yet to cross their minds. All that they wanted was, like the Moderates, not Swaraj but Suraj or good government that would remove their long-standing grievances and would bring in all-round improvements politically, culturally and economically; and this they sought to achieve not by revolutionary but by constitutional means. No wonder, therefore, even in discussions and debates in the Councils, their speeches were marked by effusion of loyalty to the British government.
241
The emergence of a group of Assamese elite, though small, imbued with advanced political ideas, produced a radical change in Assam politics. Regional patriotism gave way to national patriotism. Of the early champions of nationalism mention may be made of Nabin Chandra Bardoloi, Tarun Ram Phookun and Chandranath Sarmah. Born of a highly respectable family of Kamrup, Bardoloi was a faithful ally and loyal subject of the British government. A Moderate, as he was, he pinned his faith on constitutional agitation and took the leading rôle, as a delegate of the Assam Association, in representing the demands of his neglected province before the Parliamentary Committees both in Calcutta and London. With his unbounded faith on the liberalism of the British, during the World War I, he enrolled himself in the Bengal Light Horse and was prepared, as he says, to "die fighting for the glorious British Empire". He had high hopes that justice would be done to the Indians on the lines of the announcement of Montagu-that self-government would be a question of time and India would be a part of the "glorious Empire". To his utter disappointment and dismay, as he deplored, "one fine morning all my day-dreams and my night-dreams were

broken". There was nothing but breach of faith and act of treachery. He explains :
After I went to get the Reforms, after I fought hard for the reforms I returned to India only to see the blood-stained field of Jallianwala Bagh and the callous indifference of our rulers. I travelled to that place-I walked on the field and while there, I knelt down and said-O'God, if this is what came out of our being partners of the same Empire then save me from the Empire.72 When his heart was thus "torn to pieces" and his feelings were outraged", Bardoloi turned into a "rabid nationalist" or something more. A grandson of Jagnoram Phukan, the earliest product of English education, Tarun Ram Phookun was a moderate in his political views. A loyal supporter of the British government, Phookun had appealed to his countrymen within and outside the council to render all possible aid to Britain in her war against Germany. Now he also was disillusioned. The excise policy of the government, unjust and oppressive taxations, preferential treatment to the European Planters and, above all, the Chaliha episode in the Council disgusted him so much that he resigned his membership from the Council in which the voice of the Indian non-official members was of little effect. The denial of self-government, Khilafat wrongs, Rowlatt Act and the Jallianwala Bagh tragedy had shaken his faith altogether in the British government and made him a rebel.*
...
Bardoloi-Phookun found in Chandranath Sarmah their ablest lieutenant. With his ardent patriotism, selfless devotion and immense capacity for work, Chandranath had already shown his worth in organising the Assam Delegation to London to safeguard the interests of the province at a crucial moment. It was to the lasting credit of this young nationalist to rouse the dormant spirit of the Assamese youths then studying in

Clouds were already gathering fast in the eastern horizon-there were soaring prices, food riots, labour unrest, strikes and middle-class unemployment. At this precise moment there came the clarion call of Gandhi to embark upon non-violent non-cooperation movement. The nationalists in Assam readily responded and plunged headlong into the struggle-the saga of which will be unfolded in our next volume.

For the first time on record, the number of successful candidates from the Government and aided schools in the Brahmaputra Valley equalled the number from the same classes of schools in the Surma Valley, and of the 53 successful candidates from the Brahmaputra Valley no less than 44 were Assamese. This is very satisfactory result and it may be expected that, with the establishment of a second-grade college at Gauhati, there will be still greater progress.

A SHORT ACCOUNT OF THE RISE AND PROGRESS
OF JOURNALISM IN THE ASSAM VALLEY*
The following is a complete list of the various journals and newspapers which have been started from time to time :
(1) Arunodaya.-This monthly magazine was the pioneer of journalism in the Assam Valley, and was started in 1846 by the American Baptist Missionaries of Sibsagar, who, following the example of their brethren of Serampore, established the first printing press in Assam in 1840. From this press they issued not only numerous vernacular publications connected with the Propagation of the Gospel, but also tho magazine just mentioned, the buranji by Kacinath Tamuli Phukan, some useful educational works, and the only Assanicse dictionary which has yet been published. The Arunodaya was written in a very popular style, and was devoted to religion, science, and general intelligence. Its pages were illustrated with wood-cuts copied from the engraving of the Illustrated London News, and among other interesting items, it published an Assamese translation of an Ahom buranji and a buranji of the Chutiyas. In 1867-68, its subscribers numbered no less than 700, and it made such an impression on the people, that any newspaper issued in the province is still cailed Arunodaya by the villagers. Having diffused useful knowledge for 36 years, this magazinc was discontinued in 1882, when the Mission Press was sold.
(2) Asam-bilasini.-This was a monthly vernacular paper issued, in 1871, from the Dharmaprakash Press of the Majuli in Sibsagar. It was an organ of the Auniatiya Gosain. It was mainly a religious paper, and contained only a few items of general information. The paper continued for twelve years

and ceased to exist in 1883, when the Satra was removed to a new site.
(3) Asam mihir.-This was the first weekly newspaper in Assam. It was published, in 1872, at the Chidananda Press, Gauhati, and was at first written in Bengali, but subsequently in Bengali and English. It was discontinued in 1873 for want of sufficient support.
(4) Asum Darpana.-This was a monthly journal in Assamese, started during the year 1874-75 by a resident of the Darrang district. The paper was printed in Calcutta and published in Darrang. It existed only for a short time.
(5) and (6). In the year 1875-76, two papers, one treating of science and literature and the other of a religious nature, were edited by natives of Nowgong. These two papers were also printed in Calcutta.
(7) Goalpara Hitasadhini.-This was a weekly paper in Bengali, published in 1876, at Goalpara. It was continued till 1878, and then failed for want of support.
(8) In 1876, the Dihingiya Gosain, of Nowgong, edited a monthly magazine dealing with religious subjects, which was printed at Gauhati. It found only a limited sale among the disciples of the Gosain.
(9) Asam Dipaka.-This was a monthly journal in Assamese, and was issued from the Dharmaprakash Press in 1876. It lasted only one year.
(10) Chandrodaya.-This was a monthly vernacular magazine, and was issued from the Chidananda Press, Gauhati, in 1876, but ceased to exist after a short period.
(11) Asam News.-This was a bilingual weekly paper started in Gauhati, in 1882, and contained articles in Assamese and English. At one time it had as many as 900 subscribers, and its articles were often well written. But, owing to difficulties in the matter of editors, etc., it gradually fell off, and was discontinued in July 1885.

(12) Asam Bandhu.-This was a monthly vernacular magazine started in 1885 by Rai Gunabhiram Barua, Bahadur. It contained articles relating to science, arts, and literature, and was printed in Calcutta. Only 16 numbers appeared, and the journal was then discontinued for want of support. The editor had commenced a valuable series of articles entitled Assam past and present, but, owing to the untimely end of the paper, the series was never completed.
251
(13) Mau-This was a monthly literary journal, in Assamese, edited by Babu Hari Narayan Bara. The paper was printed in Calcutta. It made its appearance in December 1886, and was discontinued after the fourth issue, as the number of subscribers was very small.
(14) Asam Tara.-This was a monthly vernacular paper started in 1888 and published at the Dharmaprakash Press. It treated of religious, historical and literary subjects, but was discontinued in September 1890. It ceased to exist owing, it is said, to the proprietor having gone on a pilgrimage.
(15) Jonaki. This is a monthly magazine and review established by the Assamese students residing in Calcutta. The paper was started in 1889, and is still in existence. It treats of scientific, historical, and other useful subjects, and has been conducted with zeal and ability; several wellwritten original articles have appeared in its pages.
-
(16) Bijuli. This is another monthly Assamese journal, which was started by Assamese students in Calcutta. It appeared in 1890, and was discontinued before the completion of its third year. It published some interesting articles on the Muhammedan invasions of Assam.

DEAR READERS,
We have made our appearance at this junction, as the situation is one of extreme importance. Do not be deluded away by false hopes and temporary conciliations. Let not any conciliatory measure of the Government pacify you and scare you away from your path. Sacrifice white blood unadultered and pure to your Goddess in the altar of freedom. The bones of the martyrs are crying for vengeance and you will be a traitor to your country if you do not adequately respond to the call. Whites, be they men, women or children, murder them indiscriminately and you will not commit any sin but simply perform the highest Dharma. We shall appear again soon with more details. Adieu.

It is the month of May. Oh Indians, it was in this month that the first campaign of the war of Independence was begun by the Martyrs of 1857 in the battlefields of India. It was in this month that the mission of "Away with the foreigner" was proclaimed throughout the length and breadth of INDIA. It was in this month that the war-cry Maro Firungee Ko was raised by the throats of thousands. Though you died, Oh glorious Martyrs of the so called Mutiny, which in fact, was a war for the protection of religion and liberty; yet your blood was not shed in vain. It is bringing fruit to-day.

worthy successors. The flag you upheld is being done so by your worthy sous. Oh sons of the soil of India. Be Worthy of your sires. Let not the world say that the Indians break their father's vows. Let not the world even imagine for a moment that the blood of 1857 was shed without any issuc, but let the world know that the war begun in the May of 1857 is not over in the May of 1909, and shall not be over, till another May sees your destinies, Oh Indians, accomplished and your mission fulfilled.
Awaken yourself to the sense of duty and see that England, which boasted of being the shelter place of the persecuted of the continment, has turned India into a land of tyranny and repression. These mountains, which were raised by God above the crest of the earth to send forth streams into the valleys in order to make them fertile, have turned to be places of pray and robbery.
The history of the world teaches you that no man or body of men has been known yet to relinquish voluntarily powers in possesion.
The French Revolution tells you that "assassination lurks in the shadow of absolute tyranny." Many remarkable events in the history of the world reveal fully before you, that "assassination is the only weapon of disarmed patriotism." Love of the Motherland so fill your hearts that all else should appear of little importance by its side. A fervent patriotism which rejoices at every opportunity of sacrifice for the Motherland, a dauntless heart which refused to be turned back from its object by difficulty or danger, a deep faith in the purpose of providence that nothing can shake.
Take courage and continue the war begun in the May of 1857. If you die in this Revolution, you die for a cause which leads to peace on earth and glory in heaven. If you die Gita assures you of "life after death." Rise therefore Oh Brethren and work with a firm faith in God, who is head of

Extract of the proceedings of the meeting of the Assam Association held on the 14th February, 1904:
A public meeting of the Assam Association was held this evening, the 14th February, 1904, to discuss and consider on the subject of the desirability or otherwise of the expansion of the territorial jurisdiction of Assam by incorporating with her certain districts of East Bengal as proposed by the Government of India, whereon the President of the said Association was asked by the Chief Commissioner of Assam, in his letter No. 32 For.- 62-74 P., date the 8th January, 1904 to submit his opinion from the Assam point of view. The meeting was thoroughly represented by all sections and classes of people...
The President on opening the meeting asked the Secretary to read out the Proceedings of the last meeting, which having been read out by Srijut Amrita Bhusan Adhikary, Joint Secretary, Mr. Risley's letter was placed for the public discussion. Srijut Abhaya Nath Chakarbutty, Assistant Secretary, read out the letter and explained its objects very concisely both in English and Bengali, after which an elaborate discussion followed regarding the advantages and disadvantages of Assam of the proposed territorial changes from Assam point of view. The resolutions of the meetings of the several Branch Associations held at different places, viz., (1) Goalpara, (2) Barpeta, (3) Gauhati, (4) Tezpur, (5) Nowgong, (6) Golaghat, (7) Dibrugarh, were also read before the meeting. And with reference to, and in conformity with, the majority of these resolutions, the following resolutions were unanimously adopted:
Resolutions
(1) That the Association is of opinion that, even in the event of the proposed changes taking place, the new

province thus constituted cannot have a self-contained Civil Service which will attract its members, and that the Association is at one with the arguments advanced by Sir Henry Cotton, the late Chief Commissioner of Assam, in his official minute of the year 1897 on the subject of annexation of Chittagong Division to Assam.
(2) That the Division of Chittagong need not be added to Assam to give the province a port, inasmuch as the improved means of communication between Assam and Chittagong is offering her the same advantages whether Chittagong is within the province
or not.
(3) That the meeting is of opinion that the Bengal form of administration is too highly developed, too legalised, and too impersonal for such a backward province as Assam, and it apprehends that the cause of Assam and the interest of her people will greatly suffer if the highly-advanced districts of Dacca and Mymensingh be annexed at present to her territorial jurisdiction when her people has not attained to such a position as to stand without the protection, special privileges, and parental care of the Government.
"
(4) That the meeting apprehends, that by the proposed territorial change the historic name of Assam will be obliterated for ever, her language suffer, and the removal of the seat of Government to a place outside Assam proper and further away from the geographical centre will necessarily make her lose the amount of care and attention which it at present receives from the Government.
Amongst the Branch Associations, the Dibrugarh Branch suggested that Chittagong may be added to the advantage of Assam, and in the meeting at Gauripur it was suggested that, if territorial redistribution is necessary at all for the efficient

form of Government in Assam and to lighten the excessive burden of Bengal Government, it may be better effected by annexing Rangpur, Kuch Behar, Jalpaiguri, and some parts of Bogra district to Assam, as the inhabitants of those places are identical in race, religion, and language with those of Lower Assam, which is contiguous to them.
259
With regard to the latter, it was resolved that the above two suggestions be circulated to all the District Associations for their opinion, and that the matter may be brought forward in a meeting, the date of which to be fixed later on, after the replies from the branches received.

<content>Appendix F
Note dated the 31st March, 1904, by Babu Kamini Kumar Chanda, Pleader and Vice-Chairman, Municipal Committee, Silchar.
The districts of Sylhet and Cachar were transferred to Assam in 1874. The people of these districts were strongly opposed to it. In the opinion of the educated community separation from Bengal has during these 30 years deprived these districts of larger life, and of participation in general progress and culture of Bengal. They are also unable to enjoy rights and privileges which have now from time to time been secured to Bengal. It is hardly necessary to enumerate them here, but there can be no question that Sylhet and Cachar, along with the other parts of Assam, are denied privileges and advantages which people in Bengal enjoy. In social matters, too, while the eastern districts of the province have come closer to the western and more advanced districts through intimate relations, political, administrative, and commercial with Calcutta, Sylhet and Cachar continue to be as isolated
as ever.
2. But in spite of these serious drawbacks, we have become content with our present position, owing to the special and compensating advantages we enjoy in the matter of education and public service and some other matters probably, as compared to what we might have possibly enjoyed had we continued to be in Bengal. These special advantages are unquestionably due to the smallness of the area of Assam, which also makes it possible for the head of the Administration to be in touch with the leaders of public opinion and of the people in the province, and without which, in the absence of the more perfected machineries of Administration existing in Bengal or Bombay, the Assam Government would be considerably weaker than what it now is. From this, it follows that the distinctive features of Assam will, in my humble
</content>

</page>

<page>

<content>Appendix
judgement, disappear if the area and the population under the Administration are increased. The transfer of other districts to Assam will also deprive us of the special advantages which are looked upon as compensation for the loss we have sustained by being cut off from Bengal. The proposed addition of Bengal districts to Assam would therefore take away the chief source of its strength and would probably require very comprehensive changes in the Administrative machinery involving heavy expenditure which the province will be unable to bear.
261
3. Assam, even as it is at present constituted, contains communities of very conflicting interests. "There is probably no Local Government", as the Honourable High Court observed in their minute of 30th June, 1896, "which comprises of so many heterogeneous elements as that of Assam. To say nothing of the British interest in tea, coal, railway, and other industries, the province of Assam at present contains a more varied native population than probably any other province in India". There is no doubt that the addition of the Chittagong Division will very greatly increase the already existing conflicting interests in Assam and certainly enhance administrative difficulties. I believe the differences in the dialects in the province will also become more numerous.
4. The two grounds which might be thought to weigh in favour of the proposed scheme in the consideration of Assam, namely, the desirablity of having the Assam-Bengal Railway under one Administration and of having a separate port (Chittagong) for Assam, do not seem to me to be very convincing. If I mistake not, the most important railway lines in India, namely, the East Indian Railway, the Great Indian Peninsular Railway, the North-Western Railway, the Bombay-Boroda and Central India Railway, and the BengalNagpur Railway, all cover the jurisdictions of more than one Local Administration, and this fact has not, so far as my limited knowledge goes, been ever cited as in any way a grave disadvantage while the port of Karachi, which naturally should

be the port of the Punjab, is under the administration of the Bombay Government. I do not, therefore, see how the proposed transfer of the Chittagong Division can be said to be called for in the interest of Assam.
5. I would also doubt if it would be possible or desirable to create self-contained services for Assam by increasing the area in the manner proposed-even by transferring Dacca and Mymensingh; the province would, I am afraid, become less attractive for the services than it now is.
6. From the above considerations it will be seen that, in my opinion, the arguments against transferring Dacca and Mymensingh to Assam are stronger.
7. For the same reason, I am of opinion that the proposed Lieutenant Governorship is also objectionable. Beside the considerations of cost which are too serious to be ignored it would be detrimental to the interests of the present districts of Assam, owing to the headquarters of the Government being situated in Dacca, which would naturally receive a greater portion of the attention of the head of the administration which we now enjoy. Besides the province as proposed under the scheme would comprise a good many unhealthy and unpopular districts unrelieved by a fair proportion of attractive ones and will therefore be avoided by good officers and there will be a feeling of discontent among officers who will then be permanently posted here.
8. The Honourable, the Chief Commissioner invited my opinion from the provincial point of view. My opinion is therefore necessarily based on somewhat narrow and parochial grounds, though if I were to consider it from even the viewpoint of the whole of my race and nation I would be still more strongly opposd to it.

From : Srijut Nabin Chandra Bardoloi, B.L., member of the Assam Association, Gauhati.
To
The Hon'ble Rai Ghanasyam Borooah Bahadur, General Secretary, Assam Association.
Dated Gauhati, the 1st December, 1918.
I am in receipt of the resolutions passed at the last meeting of the Association at Jorhat on the 11th November last. While thankfully accepting the honour of being elected a representative of the Association and through it of the Assamese people, I am extremely sorry that I am the only person who would represent the popular views. As this measure concerns people most and as it is being looked at by officials with disfavour for obvious reasons, I think there ought to have been more representatives of the people than officials.
In this respect, I may mention that the public utterances of the people in authority in Assam on this matter are not very encouraging. The knowing portion of the population rely more on the principles of justice and liberty which the great British and American nations fought for than any opinion to be given by those who belong to the old race of administrators. Let me put a few noble sentences from the inspiring speech of President Wilson in this memorandum they are"brotherhood of mankind must no longer be a fair but empty phrase". We are fighting again for the liberty of Self-Government and the undictated development of all people.

chief, it is represented to be doing or liable to do. Hinduism in Assam was such from time immemorial and representative systems and principles are better known to the Assamese people than to any other people in India. It is only a century now that Assam has lost her independence. We are thankful to a wise providence for the fact that we have come under British rule. Any student of Assam History will say that the nobles and the nine councillors elected kings and that the council of nobles backed by the people could and did depose tyrranous kings. Even now every village containing several castes and also the so-called caste prejudices, is nothing but a representative unit, the village namghar being the common meeting place. There are many villages in which Brahmins and other high caste men live but the gaonburas are men of comparatively lower castes. The great satras of Assam are purely representative institutions. The elections of the Barpeta satra shows how keenly alive are even the commonest and the poorest men there, of their right to have a voice in the government of their sutra. There are many castes there but in spite of their everyday quarrels, the orderly fashion in which the everyday business especially on great festival days are carried on should open the eyes of detractors. The interest of the educated classes is never antagonistic to that of the poor ryots for whom the opponents of Home Rule for India has lately developed such an affection.
Before giving details I beg to submit that the present circumstances of Assam is much more favourable for granting franchise on a broad principle than anywhere else in India.
1. Tea Industry: This industry is almost monopolised by Europeans-but my Association while deprecating communal representation altogether thinks that this industry should be especially represented by one member each from the two valleys, not because they are a sturdy race of settlers (because they are not such) but because they are a powerful interest whose cause even the Government has been advocating and because the chance of election which they had from the Local

Boards being gone they must now stand from the general electorate. There also they would not stand any chance although it has been strongly urged that the educated and high class people are inimical towards the depressed people and the European people are their friends.
2. Mahammedans: My Association while strongly deprecating communal representation agrees to the reason given in the report but advocates that the seats so given should conform to the ratio of Mahammedan to other people of the Province. The number of Mahammedans being 13 per cent. Of the total population in the Assam Valley the Mahammedans should get 13 per cent of the seats alloted to the elected members. In Surma Valley the proportion of Mahammedans compared with others is 15 to 19 and seats should be alloted to Mahammedans accordingly.
3. Landholders: My Association recomends a seat for the landholders. If it is thought to be a communal representation again I would suggest that the Zamindars of Goalpara should be alloted that seat and the Zamindars of Sylhet of the same status should be given the other seat.
4. General electorate : The tests which commend to my Association are educational and payment of taxes. It should be so adjusted as to ensure the right of voting to 75 per cent of the adult male population. Assamese people would enter into the spirit of the thing very easily once they know what it is. It must be admitted by all who knows Assam that the Assam peasants are much higher in intelligence and status than similar people in other parts of India. The municipal contests at Gauhati and other places now a days show how readily Assamese people catch the spirit.
(a) Out of the 40 members in the two valleys which my Association thinks should be elected, there ought to be 19 members from the Surma Valley and 21 members from Assam Valley. The population of Surma Valley, excluding the hill districts, is, according to the last census report, 29, 70, 134

and that of the Assam Valley, excluding the hill districts, 31, 08, 669. Taking lakhs as units the ratio of Surma Valley comes to 19 out of 40.
(b) Out of the 21 for the Assam Valley my Association recommends that three seats should be reserved for Mahammedans, one for the tea industry and one for the Zamindars as stated above.

*Lakhimpur had this population during the census time. Since then the Sadiva and Eastern Districts have been separated hence the population would be much less. I therefore suggest that the two thirds of Lakhimpur should be added to the one-third of Nowgong and make it two.
(c) Surma Valley: Deducting the two seats mentioned above, there remains 17 seats for the Mahammedans and the others.
The Mahammedans are 16,22,988.
The Non-Moslems are 19,24,042.
The proportion works out at 9 non-Moslems and 8
Mahammedans.
There are however questions of figures and liable to be charged once the principle is accepted.

Qualifications of voters : I have stated above about it. My Association thinks that the following qualifications will satisfy the needs and ensure the voting rights of 75 per cent of the adult male population :
(a) Payment of revenue or rent to Zamindar to the extent of Rs. 25 or upwards.
(b) Passing the Matriculation Examination of the Calcutta University or any other equivalent examination.
(c) Payment of municipal tax or taxes to the extent of Rs. 5/- or upwards.
(d) All income tax payers.
It is hoped that this qualification would enable about 75 per cent of the adult male population to vote and the reproach that a few interested educated and high class men would form another bureaucracy would not exist.
Transferred Subjects:
Regarding transferred subjects I have nothing further to add to the list which my Association has submitted already. I can only say that personally I do not think that higher education though desirable should be brought under the minister at present. The Forest Department vitally concerns the people in their every-day life business and people think this Department to be an oppressive one in many respects, so I think that this Department should come under the control of the minister and so should Excise and Public Works, for similar
reasons.
