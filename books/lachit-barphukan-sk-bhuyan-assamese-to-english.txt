<content>Introduction The name and story of Lachit Barphukan has not spread beyond the borders of his own country. Lachit Barphukan has inspired his native Assam as Shard Nelson and Wellington in England, Metzini, Kevour and Gabildi in Italy, Maharana Prabha in Rajputana, and Shivaji Maharaja in Maharashtra. He is described for his inferior leadership on the battlefield And the glory is not limited. The main reason for this limitation is lack of publicity. Unfortunately, due to this lack, all the great and ideal deeds of Assam, the stories of the heroes of Assam, the contributions and thoughts of the Karis, philosophers and sevens of Assam have not been known. Even in Assam, the people do not know the whole story of Lachit Barphukan; They are recorded in the pages of Assamese manuscript history, and only very history has come to light. The famous hero of Assam, Lachit Barphukan, was a contemporary of Shiraji Maharaja, and like Shivaji, he prevented the establishment of yoga in his country. In fact, Lachit Barphukan&amp;#39;s main rival, King Ram Singh, was involved in the turning point of Shivaji&amp;#39;s career, the organizer of the Mahabahi empire. As a result of the work done by Ram Singh in this regard,</content>

<content>Lachit Barphukan had to come to Assam as the commander of the invincible army. And the historical material we have shows that the example of Shivaji&amp;#39;s victory against the Mughals encouraged the Assamese to effectively prevent the Mughal invasions of Eastern India. A skilled commander does not rely solely on his abundant equipment and vast army. His main reliance is on firm commitment and unwavering fearlessness. He placed more faith in the unrelenting courage of the people of the country than in the practice of warfare and politics. There are many ways in which you can improve your self-confidence.

<content>Historical Background Those of the Mughal conquest of Lachit Barphukan To follow things properly, it is necessary to know something about the political geography of Assam and the previous conflicts. In the seventeenth century AD, the kingdom of Assam extended to the Manaha Mountains in the west and the Shadiab Mountains in the east. Manaha was the eastern border of the Mughal Empire and the route to Tibet around Shadia The door. The kingdom of Assam was more than six hundred miles long and twenty-five or thirty miles wide. The Brahmaputra River flowed from one end of the state to the other. The northern part was called Uttarakhol, and the southern part Dakshinkol. At length, the kingdom of Assam was divided into two parts, Manaharpur This section up to Kaliabar is called West-Assam or South Assam and the section from Kaliabar to Shadia was called East Assam or South Assam. The city of Garhwal in southern Assam was the capital of the state of Assam at that time. Southern Assam was ruled by Barphukan, the representative of Swargadeo. His seat of government was usually at Guwahati ; But Guwahati remained under the Mughals In time, the capital of Barphukan was shifted to Kaliabar, much south of the Brahmaputra. The two forts, Chamdhara and Shimlugarh, famous in Mughal history, were located on the north and south banks of the river near Kaliabar. The enemy troops coming from the west were first attacked by Manaha, and nearby Yogighopa and the Assamese blocked the pace in Panchatan After that, to the mountains near Guwahati</content>

<content>Lachit Barphukan had a smooth navigation for a while. When the enemy crosses Guwahati, stay eight miles east of it. Attempts were made to stop the movement at Kajlimukh, followed by Chamdhara and Shimlugarh forts. Chamdharai was the last battlefield of the Assamese and if they slipped here, it would be difficult to protect the whole kingdom from the enemy near the capital, Garhwal. Therefore, the objective of the Ahom warfare was to destroy the enemy at Guwahati, which was surrounded by forts and forts, and if not, to fight again at Chamdharagarh. Ancient mountain ranges border the plains on both sides of the Brahmaputra. Its · inhabitants live according to the old customs. Regular They were able to cooperate with the Ahom rule in Garhwal with the help of donations. The kings of the hill kingdoms directly or indirectly obeyed the Ahom kings and assisted their sovereign kings by providing them with equipment and equipment during wars. The army of Assam was organized with the local inhabitants of Assam and their allies, the feudal princes, the inhabitants of the mountains and the warriors who fought with men and money at the foot of the mountains. This army had a special advantage over the Mughal army in battle due to the lack of luxuries in their daily lives. The whole edge of Assam It was for an army ready for battle. They were managed by designated officers. There was a Bora over a hundred men and a Fukan over a thousand men. There were intermediate officers—over three thousand</content>

<content>Mir Jumla&amp;#39;s Invasion of Assam In the early seventeenth century AD, the independence of southern Assam was maintained. The southern Assam was first ruled by the Kochas and then changed hands between the Ahom and the Mughals. In 1639, a treaty was signed between the Assamese general Momaitamuli Barrakriva and the Mughal general Allah-yar-Khan. According to this treaty, the whole of southern Assam starting from Guwahati fell to the Mughals. The Ahom Emperor Singh Maharaj took advantage of the illness of the Mughal Emperor Shah Jahan Padshakhya and the dispute between his sons for the throne of Delhi and drove the Mughals from Guwahati. Swargade destroyed villages near Dhaka and captured many Mughal subjects. Mughal cutters Kochbehar also declared independence. The Mughal disappeared in Eastern India after Emperor Aurangzeb invaded Kochrehar and Assam after firmly establishing himself on the throne of Delhi and ordered Mir Jumla Nawab to restore power. Mir Jumla, the ruler of Kochbeha, entered Assam in early Mirjumla Abhi easily overcame the weak barriers of the intermediate forts of Manaha and Guwahati. He captured one fortress after another. The forts of Pandu, Sarai, Guwahati and Kajli fell to the Mughals without any obstacles. The main reason for Mir Jumla&amp;#39;s free movement was the opposition and discontent among the Assamese.

<content>The subject of Lachit Barphukan was the eternal enjoyment of the Ahoms. The Ahom were a warlike Tai people and they conquered Assam in the early thirteenth century. His Majesty Jaidhwaj Singh Maharaj appointed a Hindu Kaystha as the royal representative of southern Assam and made him the commander of the army sent against Mir Jumla. This officer was named Manthir Bharali Baroua of the Bejdoli family He was referred to as “Bijdili Fukan” in Persian histories. This is the position of the Ahom, who has enjoyed power in this appointment for generations and the generals were greatly dissatisfied and angry, and the obstacles they showed to the invaders were not the ● hustle of the Ahom&amp;#39;s clever military organization, or the pride of having repeatedly defeated foreign troops. Therefore, Mir Jumla&amp;#39;s entry into Assam is the story of an unstoppable victory play. However, the conflict in the Ahom camp is the reason for this No historian has pointed out Mir Jumla&amp;#39;s campaign. The Ahom were conscious as soon as the Mughal Saidya reached Kaliabar. They are all for the enemy bases at Shimluguri and Chamdhara He focused his efforts. Mir Jumla&amp;#39;s Assam: Expedition, written in Persian, says, &amp;quot;The siege of the invincible and skyscraper fort of Shimluguri was beyond the power of even the foremost heroes of the nobility. The fortress was built by Shilen-Khan Daud-Zar, the brave general of La.

<content>Lachit Barphukan did not send any equipment to the fort, so Diler-Khai managed to break through the gates of the fort and Mir Jumla himself entered the Shimlugarh fort on 26 February 1662 and expressed his surprise at its fortifications. The Ahom army of Chamdharagarh on the north bank was terrified of Shimlugarh and left without any obstacles. After this, Mr. Buragohain He became a commander and fought the enemy at Hukurakata. in that battle The Ahom army was dispersed. Jaidhwaj Singh Maharaj fled to the mountains of Namrup, and Mir Jumla entered Garhwal on 17 March While near the capital, Mir Jumla began to suffer tragic consequences. The scene of enemy science spreading in the middle of the state awakened the latent patriotism of the Assamese. Extensive preparations were made to expel the Mughals from the country and Swargade himself began to conduct the post from outside Namrup. The Assamese soldiers zoomed in and out in different places and especially unthinkingly. They began to attack Sabar. The Ahom army took away the food utensils along the way, which caused many inconveniences and difficulties to Yogal. The Mughal historian who accompanied the expedition admitted, “The princes were looking at Delhi with satisfied eyes, the soldiers were bewildered by the children.” 1663 January Mahd Dipamon Milwarighatd Treaty between the Ahom and the Mughals is signed. The Ahom gave the South Assam AB to Yog ; Three lakhs of rupees for the expenses of the Yukta, ninety elephants to be paid to Gad Payak annually</content>

While Swargadeo was in power, he gave due reprimands to the officers who had neglected to fight against Mir Jumla, such as those who had left him. There were many such criminals in the country, and many people would have to lose their lives to give them peace. In particular, the crime was common and widespread. The king&amp;#39;s father-in-law, Rajmantri Fukan, advised Bargadeva, &amp;quot;If a few hairs fall on your head, call out. Therefore, it is important to understand the importance of these issues.

His accession marked the beginning of a new era in the conflict between the Assam Mughals. The new king was deeply saddened to see Assam becoming a Mughal kingdom. Southern Assam is under the Mughals, and the pace of the war, much is still to be paid. For this, the Fauzadar of Guwahati, Rashid-Khai, began to write letters of intimidation and harshness. Emperor Aurangzeb gave a pair of clothes or khelat to Chakradhar Singh Maharaj and the Padshahi lawyer who came to Garhwal insisted that the king should wear the clothes before them.

His sister called him Momai, so the people of the place began to call Guruti Momai.

<content>Lachit Barphukan&amp;#39;s vision and courage were the main resources of Swargade Pratap Singh. A Mughal lawyer said to the fauzadar, &amp;quot;Sir, what about Assam? The king is Sakshath Mahadev and Momaitamuli is Mahadev&amp;#39;s chief servant Nandi. These two. Momaitamuli&amp;#39;s daughter Pakhari Gavru was the princess of His Majesty Jayadeva Singh. Sultan was the third son of Emperor Aurangzeb. Mahishi Ramni Gavru of Ajmata was the daughter of Jaidhwaj Singh and Pakhari Gavru. The sons of Momaitamuli also enjoyed the highest offices of the kingdom. The present economic and moral life of Assam is the result of the system held by Momaitamuli Barbarua. In 1608, he determined the duties and procedures of the Assamese officers and the number of pikes to work under whom The subjects of Bora, Shaikia, Hazarika, Barua, Rajkhowa and Fukan were created according to the Mughal mansabdari system. However, in determining this practice, the traditional system of officer differences in Assam was also taken into account.

A good example of Momaitamuli&amp;#39;s devotion to duty can be found in contemporary Assamese history. While ruling in southern Assam, he received a letter from the Kachari king Bhimbala Narayan. In the letter, he was called the &amp;#39;King of Prayer&amp;#39; Seeing this title, Momaitamuli thought that his master, Swargadeer Pratap Singh Maharaj, was being insulted. He wrote to the Swargadeo at Garhwal about this. &amp;quot;The Kachari king is my subject. He has sent a letter to Barbarua calling him king, which shows that the commander-in-chief has great respect for me. The Kachari king has done nothing wrong. Reward his lawyer well and send him away. The main reason for Momaitamuli&amp;#39;s high position and fame was his incomparable sense of duty and his supreme loyalty and devotion to the heavenly gods. His duty, however masterful or ordinary, they are He worked hard to solve the problem. He was always true to himself and his ideals, and was inspired by the joy of comprehensive solutions in all his affairs, whatever their own gains or advantages.

The king ordered Atin Buragohain to build the necessary forts on both sides of the Brahmaputra and sent word to Lachit Barphukan, &amp;quot;A suitable commander should have an army at every military confluence. The administration of Kamrup was firmly organized and Chowdharies and Patwaris were appointed to collect the prescribed jaigiri money or revenue.

The commander of this army was Raja Ram Singh, son of Raja Jai Singh. One of the reasons why Ramdih was made commander was his military achievements. One of the reasons was peace because the Maharaja of Shiraji and Shishguk had escaped from imprisonment under the neglect of King Ram Singh of Bahas. Jai Singh Ja, a descendant of the Kachchha royal family of Anber, was deeply saddened by the deposing of Ram Singh and his refusal to go to the Emperor&amp;#39;s palace.

Shivaji was accompanied by Sanchay Ram Singh on his journey to the Mughal capital, and the princess of Amber became a close friend of Shivaji on his arrival in Agra. When he reached Agra, Ram Singh went to inform the Emperor that Shivaji had arrived. Aurangzeb ordered Ram Singh to take Shivaji to the square of Badanyah immediately. There is only one thing to welcome Shivaji He went with Ram Singh, whose name was Mukhlis-Khan, who was only a Nawab of two thousand mansabdaris. This first reception shown to Shivaji was not in accordance with his expectations. In 1664, on 12 May, Shivaji and his son Shaji were taken to the Emperor&amp;#39;s court. The Nawab Mansabdars were present in the court with great pomp. Ram Singh had Shivaji and Shantaji met by the Emperor. Shivaji greeted the Emperor from the south of the throne and gave him a tribute of forty-five thousand rupees. Shivaji was greatly dissatisfied with this reception. Earlier, Shivaji was given a manachar of ten thousand in the Mughal battle with Bijapur, today his son Ghazi received five thousand. Shivajite</content>

<content>Lachit Barfukan looked at Ram Singh&amp;#39;s le and expressed his anger freely, and reminded him of the promise made by Ram Singh himself and by his father Jai Singh. Then Shivaji went to Muscat and as a result there was a commotion among the Nawabs in the assembly. Ram Singh explained to the Emperor that Shivaji&amp;#39;s indecent behavior was due to his natural ignorance of the manners of the Mughal court and the unbearable heat of Agra. From this incident The Emperor recognized Shivaji&amp;#39;s rebellious and unrelenting attitude. He sent Shivaji away from the courtyard without showing any affection and without giving him any gift in exchange for Najrana. He was taken to the Jai Singh Palace, located outside the city fort and next to the Taj Mahal. Shivaji was guarded by a thick guard under the sword of Agra. The Emperor entrusted Ram Singh with the responsibility of looking after Shivaji. Shivaji did not hesitate to realize that his condition was critical and that it was the beginning of life imprisonment with the possibility of death. The Jai Singh playing in favor of Shivaji also failed. From outside Aurangabad, Jai Singh wrote to the Emperor that it would be better to make Shivaji an ally to protect the interests of Vadyahi from the burden. Shivajib so that no harm is done, Raf so that he will tell him Jai Singh repeatedly instructed his son Ram Singh to ensure that there was no exception to the assurance of security. Meanwhile, the Emperor&amp;#39;s mind was distracted by the distorted account of the conflict with Afzal-khi and Sayista-kha. He was poisoned by Shirazi.

The Emperor told Ram Singh that there was no way for the king to speak out about this. their own hopes and confidence And with his resolutions kissed, and with no possibility of independence, Shirazi became anxious in his mind and voice in the palace of Jai Singh at Agra. He began to obey the orders of the Padshakhya and pretend to surrender to his fate. Shivaji showed friendship to Omraonkal and satisfied him with gifts. Ram Singh began to spend huge sums of money in gathering reliable information about Shivaji. When the construction of the iron-salt building was completed, the Emperor offered Shiraji Bhat Khar. Ram Singh heard of this resolve and informed Shivaji. Shivaji had no choice but to use his own intelligence to escape this crisis. He set out a path of reasoning, and his genius was a skillful invention, for by resorting to it he was able to dust the eyes of the clever and cautious emperor. Shirazi sought permission from the Emperor to send his men back to the south. Cars in Yogal Bajdhani are also regular Shivaji averred to bring his wife and mother with him so that he could save money and support himself.

<content>Shivaji wanted to send Lachit Barphukan. Ram Singh and Balaji Chivnich went and captured the Finance Minister Bahulla-Khan, and with his help Shivaji&amp;#39;s house The emperor gave permission to send out containers of sweets and provisions. Huge bamboo and cane pots filled with food began to go out through the palace gate. Shivaji&amp;#39;s friends even sent gifts inside. At first the steel-salt guards looked at the pots carefully, but later the guards began to relax them as it was a routine thing to do the guardians They satisfied him with gifts and sweets, thinking that Shivaji was a very kind man who had been cruelly imprisoned by the prince. They tested some of the paci and allowed them all to be sent out. Then Shivaji pretended to be sick and called the best doctors in Agra After a day or two, Shivaji announced that he had recovered, and began sending out more sweets to celebrate his recovery. The Brahmins sent three smokes through Mathura as a gift to them that Shivaji had been healed because of their prayers to Krishna. On 19 August 1666, Shivaji and his son Shankaji entered Chuta Pasib, and were taken to Duabedi to stay. They had no doubt as they passed through the guards. On his way out of Agra, Shivaji and his son left Pachi, and met the three waiting-faithful friends sent by Shivaji. Then they went to Anura and disguised themselves as beggars</content>

<content>SOS caught up. Shivaji reached Pune in late December 1666, passing through the states of Allahabad, Varanasi, Puri, Gandwana, Hyderabad and Bijapur. He told everyone that he had left Horen and had returned. The people of Pune were overjoyed. Officers and soldiers went in thousands to congratulate Shivaji, and heard from him the story of his escape. Shivaji&amp;#39;s escape caused a stir in Agra. Aurangzeb searched for Shirazi and all to find him He issued orders to the local officials. By order of the Emperor, Ram Singh was responsible for Shirazi&amp;#39;s escape, so he was blamed for Shivaji&amp;#39;s escape. When Jancherek arrested the Maradhi Brahmins and questioned them, they said that Ram Singh had advised them and neglected them at will. Ram Singh was allied with Vidar Shivaji, and the Emperor immediately believed that Bharpara Ram Singh had the cooperation as he supported him. The Emperor made peace with Ram Singh by not allowing him to come to Padyah&amp;#39;s courtyard and after a few days by taking away his dignity and salary. Ram Singh&amp;#39;s father Jai Singh was deeply saddened by his son&amp;#39;s insult. In a letter written at this time he said, “His present misfortune is that Jai Singh, the charge of the Akhgunir of destiny, added in the letter,—“From the letter of the representative at Padyah Chora I learned that the Emperor The reason for this is that the Brahmins of Shirazi follow the conspiracy of selfish people</content>

<content>Lachit Barphukan says, &amp;quot;It is due to the lack of advice and caution of Ram Singh that Shivaji was able to escape. May God curse anyone who thinks that Ram Singh has such faith in his heart. After Shivaji&amp;#39;s flight, Bhai Singh fought against Bijapur for some time and remained in the south. His money, people, and all his possessions began to run out. He appealed to the emperor for new equipment, but the emperor ignored him. Aurangzeb suspected that Jai Singh would join Shivaji in taking up arms against the Padshahi army. Such indifference and suspicion on the part of Aurangzeb led Jai Singh to save the lives of the Rajput heroes who were to be humiliatingly defeated in the Battle of Bijapur without reward. Therefore, Jai Singh brought the army and feudal lords to Aurangabad. Jai Singh was able to defend the forts left by Shivaji with great difficulty. The Emperor was unable to succeed in the Battle of Bijapur, and Ram Singh devised a way to &amp;#39;flee Shivaji, from the Churbedari of Dakshinatya Jai Singh was removed and Sultan Moazzem was appointed to the post. The Sultan is with the Shawli The Emperor ordered Jashovastu Singh to go as commander. In May 1667, Jai Singh was officially removed from the post of Churedar of South India &amp;#39;According to the Emperor&amp;#39;s orders, broken-hearted and desperate, and tormented by old age, poverty and humiliation, Jai Singh set out for the Mughal capital, but on 2 July 1667 Mirzaz was captured at Barhanpur</content>

Reaction to Aorjev&amp;#39;s behavior towards Java Singh In fact, people remembered Jai Singh&amp;#39;s benevolent deeds for the Emperor. This is the story of the Italian savior Nilao Mehxi It is known. He worked as an armory employee under King Jai Singh and Kirat Singh. This reaction is also reflected in a letter written by Ram Singh&amp;#39;s mother and wife while he was in Assam. After the death of Jai Singh, Ram Singh ascended the throne of Anber. Aurangzeb supported Kirat Singh as king, but the subjects refused to accept him as king, thinking that he was a murderer. 500 Aurangzeb was a man of lustful politics. The Emperor realized that it was not without danger to allow the Rajput&amp;#39;s dissatisfaction to live indefinitely. Ram Singh was showered with royal favor and received back the title of king and the manas of four thousand. The Emperor also gave him these gifts: – a meal of chirpao, a box of bakhar leaves, half a pearl, a saw smoke with golden jeans, and a golden carriage an elephant adorned with clothes, and ornaments. The Emperor had not forgotten that Ram Singh had helped Shivaji escape, although he tried to hide his true attitude under the guise of gifts and rank given by Ram Singh, the new king of Anber.

<content>The Emperor heard the news that Syed Firoz Khan, the policeman of Lachit Barphukan Hati, had been arrested. He appointed Ram Singh as the commander of the Padshahi army sent against the kingdom with the intention of giving peace to it. 308 In the imagination of the people of the Mughal Empire, Assam was a joyous, and unhealthy place from which few could return in good time. This opinion became entrenched when Nawab Mir Jumla died shortly after leaving Assam. The public thought that Ram Singh had been sent against Assam as a peace to support Shivaji. Sir Jadunath Sarkar says, &amp;quot;It was very unpleasant to serve in Assam, and no soldier would go to Assam unless forced to do so. In short, there is good reason to believe that Ram Singh was sent to Assam as punishment for helping him escape from captivity at Agra. The savior Mekukshi also supports this view,—&amp;quot;Jai Singh sent his son Ram Singh to Assam in revenge for Shivaji&amp;#39;s escape. The Emperor knows that Mir Jumla suffered the same fate when he went to Assam. in contemporary Assamese histories This is the view mentioned. Apart from Shivaji, another well-known leader was released with the help of Bam Singh. This was the second reason for Aurangzeb&amp;#39;s dissatisfaction with Ram Singh.

Only Masuh of the rank of king and Nawab is the object of the Emperor&amp;#39;s anger. He is a beggar fakir. People will laugh at me if I am held responsible for his escape. The Emperor, hearing this, kept his dissatisfaction in mind and did not give any peace to Ram Singh, remembering the help the Kachchha kings had given to the Mughals The Emperor, hearing this message, said to Ram Singh, &amp;#39;King Jai Singh, son of Mandhata, has fought against Bengal and subdued him You go to the battle of Assam There are many ways to get a job, but the most important thing is to get a job.

He was slightly obstructed at the border police station, but soon overcame that obstacle. The Assamese&amp;#39;s objective was to enable the Mughal army to advance unhindered near Guwahati, and to stay on both sides of Guwahati They could well block the Mughal army from Behugarh. Ram Singh first established a police station near Hajo, then encamped in nearby villages and fields. The method of warfare adopted by Jai Singh against Shivaji by Ram Singh followed the following. Ram Singh sought to resolve the issue of war through diplomatic movements, and with it promises and assurances, failing which he intended to end the war by military conflict. Ram Singh tried to enrich the Ahom generals with gifts of wealth and gold and to create divisions among them. However, while Rajput diplomacy was partially successful in the war against Shivaji, it failed completely in Assam. The conflict culminated in the Battle of the Waters near Guwahati in March In that battle, Ram Singh&amp;#39;s army was defeated and Hatra was broken.

The burden fell first on Abu Nasr Khan and then on Ibn Hussain Khan. In June 1676, Ram Singh went to greet the Emperor. Ram Singh was in the Sinast of Assam only as punishment for so long.

His knowledge of astrology was so deep and extensive that he was commissioned by the Mughal Emperor Muhammad Shah to reform the calculation of astrological rushes. Jasingh named some of his devastating collections after the poet Dak Samrat, calling him Veiz Mohammad Chahi. In 1829, Colonel James Todd said, &amp;quot;These rules have hitherto been used to prepare astronomical calculations. In Delhi, Jaipur, Varanasi and Mathura he built or mandaps or yantra-mantras for astrological calculations, and installed instruments of his own invention in them. Everyone was amazed at the accuracy of the calculations made with them. He was able to continue his astronomical research despite constant wars and royal disputes. Jai Singh kept a diary called Kalpadrum, recording the executions in which he himself participated and the events that came to his case. He collected materials for a compilation of a comprehensive history of the Kachchora dynasty. 190 After the death of Emperor Aurangzeb, during the war between his sons for the throne, Cherai Jai Singh supported Azamshah or Ajmatara, the third son of the late Emperor.

<content>Conclusion It is difficult to fully portray the personality and character of Lachit Barphukan with the tools available to us. The events of his life in the histories are royal Vakeshe makhon associated with the activity have been recorded. He is described in the history as a stage in the chain of political events However, this level is also essential. No matter how glorious and noble a man in history may be, he has no place in history unless his environment influences the decisions and actions of the royal household. Historians were strictly forbidden to give prominence to irrelevant events of personal life. We say this after the order of Shiva Singh of heaven to an Ahom scholar to write the history of the kings We learn,—“This history must contain only the names and deeds of the heavenly gods”. It is regrettable that we have received abundant character books of the saints and religious leaders of Assam and many political biographies would have been written in our country, if they had been compiled according to the rules of the country. With the help of such life characters we would have gained an intimate glimpse of the inner attitude, and from it we would have been able to get an accurate idea of the characters of the major leaders of history.

A man with self-respect is always hopeful and neutral, and restrictive, without regard to the promises and commitments we make, and the words and attitudes of others Despite his inconvenience, he follows his principles. Truth is secret, unbelievers you don&amp;#39;t believe, it&amp;#39;s a solution to the problem. It is a panglog to prove the action of the wisdom and irregularities to be reasonable.

<content>Lachit Barphukan Keto complained. Plutarch says that in response to this accusation, Sippius said, &amp;quot;He does not want an auditor to observe his affairs, since he was engaged in a great war, and told Cato that the general must show the Romans only how many battles he won. Therefore, it is important to understand the importance of these characteristics He “threw away the opinion of men and used all his energy for one purpose—“we must be cruel anyway.” His actions were supported by Swargadeo. This decision shows Lachit Barphukan&amp;#39;s power to judge what is necessary and what is not necessary. Lachit Barphukan instilled the dream in the hearts of the soldiers from the beginning and created the impression in the hearts of Ram Singh that his defeat was inevitable The Ahom commander replied that he was ready to fight until he had the last drop of blood in his body of the soldiers</content>

<content>Lachit Barphukan&amp;#39;s characteristics are like sand in a pot. When invited to make a decision without fighting, Lachit Barphukan said that Ram Singh must show his intelligence on the battlefield, otherwise he would be destroyed It will be stigmatized. The Dhut of Assam explained to Ram Singh that many kings had come with Barphukan and that demon soldiers had taken part in Barphukan&amp;#39;s army. As a result of this propaganda, Ram Singh realized the possibility of his impending disaster. Assam was an unknown land for the Rajput generals and soldiers. Therefore, they easily believed everything that contained a little truth. These words were spoken with respect and firmness, so it was understood that the Ahoms were Kamils People, and they have not come to win wars with diplomacy and outward politeness alone. Lachit Barphukan worked very hard to preserve the confidence of his soldiers. His subject is for the destruction of the enemy and the soldiers pleaded with Goddess Kamakhya. According to the sincere belief of the Assamese, the goddess fulfilled the wishes. From there the soldiers knew that the enemy was defeated. Lachit Barphukan proposed to cut off those who neglected their duties without informing Swargadeo. This is for those who want to neglect the war or give up the war The people were dutiful, and everyone put their strength to the utmost in the work of war. Therefore, it is important to understand the importance of these issues. Therefore, it is important to understand the importance of these issues.

<content>The Lachit Barphukans became more confident of victory and began to fight with great enthusiasm. The Ahoms heard this praise from the mouth of Hangal-Bhanga Lankar. He was the leader of Lachit Barphukan in the Battle of Saraighat. He had a high fever and had to be treated in that illness. He threw two signatures into the water with the throne of the sword, and the soldiers who had given up the battle were refreshed, and they began to fight with all their might. His words testify to his passionate anxiety for the freedom of the country and for the preservation of his self-esteem Therefore, it is important to understand that the present situation is not the same as the previous situation.

<content>Lachit Barphukan ran towards the boat. The fear of defeat soon turned into the indestructible glory of Buddhajaya. A leader without proper foresight turns a blind eye to the corruption of his subordinates. He thinks that the van will increase the interest of the employees in performing their duties. Because of such neglect, he eventually falls himself, because subordinates are neglectful if they do not expect money and gifts received dishonestly They start doing it. As their greed grows, they tell the enemy secrets in exchange for money, and help the enemy in times of crisis through their habitual or deliberate negligence, even if not openly. This is the first time that I have seen a guy with a smile on his face. He severely punished Ramcharan Katki for asking Ram Singh for two wooden birds. Churamani promised the fortune teller Rs. 4,000 if he accepted a job under Ram Singh. The fortune teller jokingly wanted to meet Ram Singh, but he suppressed his interest for fear of Lachit Barphukan. Barphukan ordered Bhakatdah Katki to be thrown into the water for trying to kidnap Churamani Daibajya to Ramsingh. Real power cannot be created unless everyone&amp;#39;s mind is morally pure. This protection is essential in times of national crisis, because the efforts of wise princes and generals may fail from the temptation of a commo. Thanks to the inspiration of Lachit Barphukan, every soldier from the highest commander to the general attendant was freed from temptation and corruption. Barphukan did not allow his soldiers to steal the boats of the defeated and fleeing soldiers for any reason</content>

Therefore, it is necessary to take into consideration the fact that the present invention is not limited to the field of physics, but also includes the field of biology, chemistry, and physics They are not tired yet.” Lachit Barphukan was also a human being. His commanders and soldiers scrupulously obeyed his orders. The Commander-in-Chief of the Northern Army, Mr. Mahamantri Buragohain They were afraid to disobey Barfukan&amp;#39;s orders. This loyalty was not the same as the compulsion created in the hearts of the people by an authoritarian leader to maintain his power and authority. Barfukan was always cautious and cautious. There are many ways to get away from these things, but the most important thing is to get away from these things. There are many ways to get away from these things. The sainthas were placed in separate shifts in an orderly and-well-planned manner. Despite the excellent arrangements of the Assamese armor, the feeling of terror in the hearts of the Rajput generals, the hopeful predictions of the fortune-tellers, and the assurance of victory from these, Lachit Barphukan did not sit idly by. Belief in victory is essential for motivation, but it cannot replace discipline and organization. Yogal is approaching, chasing tightly; Achutananda Dolay has given the right to kill Khensilai.

<content>Lachit Barphukan was confused. Barfukan obeyed the astrological signs to the letter, but he was very angry and troubled. In such trouble, he began to frighten the fortune-teller. However, the signal soon passed, and the fortune teller declared that the attack was auspicious. Barphukan still did not suspect that Achutananda&amp;#39;s behavior was treacherous. At the end of the battle, the king rewarded Dalai well, however, on the advice of Barphukan. 124 Two hundred and seventy-five years later In review, we must admit that whatever the scientific value of astrological calculations, people then and still some consider them inaccurate and unjust. Lachit Barphukan accepted that calculation and proved only a custom of the time. But we must admit that Lachit Barphukan called for a great crisis by turning astrological advice into a war system in times of trouble. Although widely practiced among the people, astrological calculations are not universal. No commander should handle the critical problems of war with the help of these calculations, which are practically of dubious benefit Even if it is a scientific calculation, there may be mistakes. While no one can speak out about the honesty of Achyutananda Dolay, there may be doubts about the honesty of other people in the business. Like other contemporaries, Lachit Barphukan relied heavily on the decision of one man, which was a mistake for him, although there was no consequence for the delay in his death. This mistake is how dangerous Ram Singh&amp;#39;s devotion to Dairaj was</content>

<content>We can see from the repeated attempts to overthrow Lachit Barphukan. 125 The enemy troops were preparing very near the fort around Guwahati. Lachit Barphukan was well aware that the independence of Assam was in danger. This realization is the source of Barphukan&amp;#39;s love of his country. He climbed to the top of the fort and saw the pomp of a huge army in the bahr of Ram Singh. An eyewitness said, &amp;quot;Seeing this scene, Barfukan began to shed tears, saying, &amp;#39;This is what happened to me in the days of Fukan! How will my king be saved? How will the people be saved? How will they be saved later?&amp;#39; There is nothing wrong with that. Fukan knew that no matter how fortified he was and how prepared he was for battle, no one could predict the outcome of a battle. They are the kings of the Assamese thought to be the genesis of kind of enterprise and micro-inspiration. Lachit Barphukan was fortunate to have Chakradhar Singh Swargade as the ruler of the kingdom. This is the one There is little comparison between the patriotism and self-respect of the kings in the history of Assam. Chakradhar Singh initially suffered somewhat as a result of the humiliating deeds left by Agarjana Swargade. When the Mughals insisted on paying the remainder of the Peshak fixed in 1663, Chakradhar Singh thought of himself as a subordinate king and said, “It is better to die than to be under the Bengals”. So they decided to fight again. The Mahamantri Buragohain suppressed the strong interest of the Swargadeo in due course. Mr. explained that the equipment of war had not yet been sufficiently assembled. Swargadeve</content>

<content>Lachit Barphukan himself began to watch the preparations for the battle, set up a blacksmith&amp;#39;s shawl inside the fort, taught himself the sword, and finally was satisfied that everything was ready. It is complete and measured. Meanwhile, Swargade Chakradhar Singh had sent letters to the neighboring princes seeking their cooperation and support to halt the Mughal movement. We can get a good idea of his patriotism and self-respect from the letters written by Swargade at that time. In June 1664, Swargade wrote to King Prananarayan of Kochrehar, &amp;quot;You know well that I have repeatedly made fun of the Mughals. But if God has done this to us once, will it happen to us again and again?&amp;quot; In February 1665, Chakradhar Singh wrote again to Prana Narayan,—“The Mughals have once made us happen, but shall we not try to remove this insult”? The selection of Lachit Barphukan as the commander of the new army is a good testament to the insight and vision of the king. If he had been a commander who survived by mistake, he would have acted differently. But the general whom Swargade saved in this case was inspired by Swargade&amp;#39;s zeal and patriotism. and he is from Guwahati to the Mughals He was able to drive them out. Therefore, it is necessary to take into consideration the following factors: The name of Chakradhar Singh Maharaj will always be remembered in the history of Assam for his mighty personality and his achievements in restoring the lost glory of the country: Mahamantri Atan was the third of the three heroes</content>

<content>Lachit Barphukan 1) Buragohain Dangbia He suppressed the unrestrained proposals of Swargadeo Chakraparakta Singh and Lachit Barphukan with firm and visionary advice. Buragohain Dangbiy He was a high-ranking politician. His acceptable and reasonable advice was highly valued by kings and officials. There are many ways to get a job He was also a great warrior, and he encamped on Mount Lachia and led the northern army. Lachit Babfukan consulted frequently with the Burhagohai, and all necessary decisions were the result of discussions among the men. Buragohain is a skilled military craftsman and the fort of Chariomer of Guwahati was designed by him and built under his supervision. . . . . ? Therefore, it is important to understand the importance of these issues. Therefore, it is important to understand the importance of these issues. Ramsingh is an Assamese He gathered news about the generals, and his comments about Atan Buragohain meant,—&amp;quot;I am amazed that a man can be so sharp at such a young age. Who can call him blessed when he grows old?&amp;quot; When he saw that the proposed course of action was wrongly planned, Buragohain was able to signal a new rule of course with his original thought and insight. Chakradhar Singh decided to fight the Mughals immediately. Therefore, it is necessary to take into consideration the fact that the ice cream of Bengal cannot be tolerated.

At the same time, Mr. Buragohain worked in harmony and with the same purpose in different departments of the army Therefore, it is important to understand the importance of these issues. Therefore, it is important to understand the importance of these issues. Therefore, it is important to understand the importance of these issues 128. Lachit Barphukan was concerned about the loss of ten thousand soldiers of Assam in one day Don&amp;#39;t give up hope of victory. They also killed eight or ten people while planting a pond inside the garden. Finally, how many big fish can we catch? That&amp;#39;s what you have to look at. Why shouldn&amp;#39;t two or four men fall, knowing that this is a battle?” This is the same.

They don&amp;#39;t understand good or bad. They have joined the battle with the permission of the Bargade, and without rushing to Barphukan&amp;#39;s chat, they rush to catch him.</content>

<content>Lachit Barphukan They come suddenly and attack, and no one can argue their movements.” Although Madhavacharan&amp;#39;s description was exaggerated to create terror in the minds of the enemies, there was much truth in it We learn from the encouraging words of King Pranarayana of Kochbehar and King Jaintia that they wanted to defeat the enemies of Jaidhvaja Singh Because you shouldn&amp;#39;t be sad. Behold, Ramachandra, Suratha, Yudhisthira, these too were deposed. The king of Kochbehar also wrote, “We are If you can fight with one mind Then the enemy will have no advantage, and fate will help us for revenge.” The letter of the king of Jaintia was a similar expression of desire,—“Jaintir And Garhwal is not two. Therefore, it is important to note that the letter of King Manik Singh also showed special sincerity and cooperation,—“When your country was killed by the Bengalis, we settled down safely. We are displeased that our people did not come to your service. At such a time, we will not give you seven, and we will be ashamed of ourselves. Therefore, if we can ever persecute the enemy and remove him, we will be ashamed.”</content>

<content>Therefore, it is necessary to send a strong army to the Ahom to help Lachit Barphukan in the battle. The Queen of Katalia participated in the wars of this era with great fame. He caught a few fugitive Mughals in Pandu, cut off their fingers and sent them to Barphukan. There are many ways to get a job in Guwahati, but the most important thing is to get a job in Guwahati For his heroic exploits, the heavenly gods richly rewarded the queen king. Other Kabtalia kings This is how they helped. Later, Kadra Singh Swargade helped him with twenty thousand soldiers by playing Relika, Daranga, Beltala, Rani, Na-Duwar, Topakuchi, Dimkara, Jayantira and Kasab. They also gave troops to the kings of Barduar, Pantan, Bholagaon, Panrari, Kulta, Neli, Gova, Hojai and Garkhia. The number of soldiers who gave how many It is not known now. Therefore, it is important to understand the importance of these issues. Therefore, it is important to understand the importance of these issues. He said that the soldiers of the Kacharis and the kings of Jaintiapur who had met Har Par had found Kai without food. The participation of the border troops of Assam in wars shows that Assam received their cooperation and support in all national crises. Seeing the leadership of the Assamese from the hands of temptation, the organizational arrangements, Ram Singh doubted his success, and reflected what he had said to Shuru Tewrahahar before leaving for Eastern India. Seeing this, Ramsingh said, “Our Hisere X argitača,</content>

Therefore, it is important to understand the importance of these characteristics in the development of the country I have never seen Oman poor in India.” Ram Singh summed up his sad experience by saying, “Whoever comes before Anan will be stabbed in the cheek with a bone marrow”. The opinion expressed by two women of the Ghekshan royal family about the pious character of the Assamese was the queen of the greatest praise about the Assamese. &amp;quot;We have heard that the glory of Naam Kirtan has been introduced in that country from house to house, and that rice has been served by cows, Brahmins, Vaishnavas and Mahanurs.

<content>&amp;quot;The Emperor summoned me and asked me to conquer Kamarupa. I went home and told my mother and Mahirirupa about the Emperor&amp;#39;s conversation. They were afraid and asked, &amp;#39;I am going to die. They also explained that “there was no other brave hero like Mir Jumla. What hope can there be if he goes to Assam and dies”? The royal family of Anber was a devout Vaishnava. They built temples at Vrindavan, Phulpur, Varanasi, Pushkar, and Haridwar, testifying to their passion for Vaishnavism. According to one of the queens of Pudna, Assam was a sacred kingdom; No one should disturb the peace of this kingdom, for doing so will not leave the disturber without its burden! An example of this is the death of Mir Jumla shortly after leaving Assam. 200 The two queens of Anber spoke of the Namkirtan introduced throughout Assam. This is the result of the revival of Vaishnavism, which was established with the help of Mahapurushas Sankaradeva, Madhavade, Damodavade and their devotees Sambha-Mahanta. Vaishnava satras are established all over the country and the glory of Aikrishna! There are many different types of ceremonies and rituals that are performed in the village Namghar and Kirtan Ghar in the family. They are sung to the tune of past music composed by Sankaradeva and his devotees. The villages of Assam from Eur to Limur were filled with the sound of Naam-Kirtan, especially in the crowds related to the Three of the Seven and Krishna. The Ahom kings Jayadhvaji Chakraj Singh and Udaradhitya Singh fell under the influence of the Vaishnavas.</content>

<content>Lachit Barphukan is a popular name-kirtanb| It has been introduced to this day. There are many satras in the Majuli region of Eastern Assam Located in the. When one goes there, one cannot fail to be fascinated by the intense influence of Vaishnavism. In view of the circumstances in which Ram Singh had to come to Assam, and the circumstances he faced in Assam, many may think that he relaxed in the performance of his duties. An old Assamese history clearly states that Ram Singh was depressed on hearing the news of Krishna Singh&amp;#39;s fire test before Emperor Aurangzeb and the warnings of the king&amp;#39;s mother and queen, although he said that it would not be right for him to turn away from battle. There is another history,—“Say this, he did not fight when he heard the fame of Ram Singh&amp;#39;s son being converted to Islam instead of Padshahab”. A third history states,—“The reason why Ram Singh repeatedly sought Guwahati to Barphukan is this: Before coming to Assam, Ram Singh had taken an oath of truth before the Padshah.” The king also promised him to perform Umrah if he could conquer Assam. The king said, &amp;quot;If you cannot, I will cut off your neck, and take your children, daughters, and prisoners away from your country. Ram Singh came to Guwahati in a state of B, and what he heard when he came here must have been disappointing and discouraging. But he is neglectful in performing his duties Therefore, it is necessary to take into consideration the characteristics of the Rajpur. Neglect and neglect of duty are only broad translations of the phrase betrayal and, in particular, it is well known that the prince once promised to kill the postman. &amp;#39; &amp;#39;</content>

<content>Lachit Barfukan will also fill it. Conscientiousness is at the heart of Rajput character. Ancient and noble turtles Sultan Akbar, son of Aurangzeb, once wrote to the Emperor, “There is no doubt that the princes are worthy of praise for their devotion and courage”. Melukshi, the wanderer of Vesinch, knew the princes well, and served under Jayasingha. Mejukshi said, “In short, the Rajputs are innocent and pious, they keep their promises, and they respect the words of their mouths as authentic evidence”. James Todd, the historian of the Rajputs, wrote in 1829,—“If you ask a Rajput what is the most guilty crime, he will commit &amp;#39;gunchore&amp;#39;, that is, forgetfulness of grace It cannot be separated from vocal religion or devotion to the Lord. He who does not have these qualities is considered unworthy of life, and at the end of his life he suffers eternal torment of Yama. The character of the Rajputs is known from the royal historians up to the days of Akbar, Jahajir and Aubangwe. The famous Dighitaras of the Emperor were also edited by the Rajput allies They lost their cooperation as a result of their good treatment of the Ballipus</content>

<content>Lachit Barphukan did. British troops are involved in Assam, and the results have caused panic in the British capital. This Assam was conquered by a Rajput king, and his descendants are now the allies of the British government. 16 The Rajputs had associated with the Mughals for many centuries and were often dissatisfied with their allies. But no Rajput king has acted treacherously by breaking his promises and oaths. King Mansingh of Anber lamented that he was always involved in warfare, saying, “I am sent to all the battles, I have no time to sit and rest, my soldiers are unnecessarily harassed, and they swear at me”. However, Mansingh never neglected the duties of the Padshahi. When Emperor Shah Jahan went to Anber, the Rajput heroes advised Jai Singh to capture the Emperor. Jai Singh replied, &amp;quot;Our dynasty has never done such a thing. Padya may treat us unfairly by listening to others, but we should not be hostile as you say. We have never betrayed the Mughal footsteps. Jai Singh met Aurangzeb in a forest called Lakshmi on the southern bank of the Chatlej River. Padanshah had only five cavalry, and Jai Singh was accompanied by three thousand Rajput cavalry. Seeing Aorjjev thus unprotected, Jai Singh&amp;#39;s officers advised the king, “Let the king himself kill Padstah, or allow us to kill him.” Setukshir says of this,—“By killing Aurjajeva, the captive Hahjahan alone can be freed, and by this action Jayasingha</content>

<content>But the king ignored this advice, although the facilities were good and the editing was easy. Shivaji is known to have tried to awaken King Jai Singh&amp;#39;s devotion to Hinduism, and to organize an anti-Mughal Sangh with his support Shivaji&amp;#39;s efforts in action were in vain. On the other hand, Jai Singh took advantage of the fact that Shivaji and Jai Singh were Hindus to fulfill the Emperor&amp;#39;s resolve. King Jai Singh sent a lawyer to Shirandhi saying: Narapati, you are his friend Recommended ! The end result of enmity is not good. I am a Hindu and the king of the kingdom of Jaipur, and you are the Chichodia of the Udaipur royal family. The land is the seventh of a well-known dynasty. The preservation of our religion has been passed down from generation to generation, and you are striving for it. Know that my assembly is unwavering towards you. It is my sincere desire to protect Domak and your kingdom. Tell me of your wishes.” He wrote to the Emperor of how Jai Singh had exerted himself in the accomplishment of his purpose,—“I am so busy accomplishing the purpose for which I have been sent that I cannot be distracted for a moment day or night.” Against Ram Singh, accusations of over sincerity in the performance of duty, alliance with the enemy, or treachery go against the Bajpur character</content>

<content>Lachit Barphukan was further ashamed that he had tried to make up for his defeat in 1671 by staying on the border for five years. Ram Singh suspected that Rashid-Khai was allied with Assam. As a result, Rahid-Khak was driven out of the Mughal camp. 138 The main reasons for Ram Singh&amp;#39;s defeat in the Battle of Assam were the lack of Mughal equipment, the Rashid-Khar rebellion; and the fort of Durvent Guwahati, the invincible attitude and discipline of the Assamese generals. The reasons for Ram Singh&amp;#39;s defeat in Assam as analyzed by Sir Jadunath Sarkar can be quoted here, “Ram Singh had only eight thousand cavalry with him, and when his army was exhausted it was rarely replaced and the Mughals could do little in the waters of the Brahmaputra with only twenty warships.” Har Jadunath Sarkar then mentions the disobedience and judgment of Rashid-Kha. He demanded equal status with Ram Singh, and refused to obey Ram Singh&amp;#39;s orders. It is also believed that Rahid Khan became an ally of the Ahom. . . . . ---- There is some disagreement about the number of Saivas of Ram Singh. According to Sir Rasnath Sarkar, salary from himself with the king. Dvir. 4,000 cavalry, 1,500 foot soldiers, and 500 hilar dait. 15,000 Bhirandajas joined as Maharkari Saityas from Kochrehar, they were not proficient in the forest Buddha and other subjects Vaibhave Mahar who worked in the kingdom</content>

<content>The Emperor ordered his subedar to make Lachit Barphukan. The history book “Machiri-Alamgib” mentions 1,500 Ahladi and 500 Hilamra soldiers. But there is no mention of the four thousand who ate the king&amp;#39;s salary and the 15,000 archers of Kochbehar. The contemporary Assamese history gives the number of soldiers of King Ram Singh as follows: “30,000 sepoys given by the Emperor; There were Kabishekhar Blokra, Sarveshwar Barua, Manmath Barua, Ghanshyam Bakshi, and 15,000 Dhali and Tibandaz.” and it is known from one history that the Subedar of Bengal, Sista-kha, gave an army of 2,000 soldiers to Ram Singh The numbers are also taken from this news. The main army given by the Emperor was the cavalry of Bamsingh, eleven Therefore, the number of soldiers recorded in the history of Assam cannot be dismissed as unreliable There was a lot of water.</content>

<content>Lachit Barphukan The main army of the Ahoms was the army trained by Bargader Chakradhar Singh in the capital of Garhwal; Then the army in Guwahati and the nearby Khanas, the feudal kings, the Jaintia kings and other allied kings sent troops to increase the number of troops of the two main armies. There are many ways to get a job in the field of architecture Older generation There were many, and they could be trained and sent to war in a short time. It is no exaggeration to say that the Ahom could muster 100,000 troops. This is evidenced by a newspaper dated 10 December 1669 in the square of Aurzev. When the officer returned with a Padshahi decree to the Subedar of Bengal, the Emperor asked him about the number of troops in Assam. Nisar-Beg said that he had heard from King Ram Singh that the number of infantry and cavalry in Assam was about 100,0 The number of horsemen is very heavy.” Lachit Fukan had many soldiers, so he ran a sword at nine hand intervals on the mountains and south of the mountains, and one hand at intervals on the fort of Raddha This system was introduced around the forts on both sides of the Brahmaputra. Ram Singh was forced to fight with caution due to the small number of troops, as he did not want to lose his troops by fighting Jathai-Sabai. Besides, Ram Singh&amp;#39;s lost army was rarely replaced. Ram Singh is said to have brought only the Lakhon Chukubi with him. Mirbhushala initially had 323 warships of various types, and 280 of them were operated</content>

Ram Singh could have increased the number of his boats as there were two famous boat ports near Hajo, one at Ramdia and the other at Gualkuchi. Ram Singh once captured many Assamese Maos and sent 500 of them against the enemy. These boats were built for barges, and their sterns are described as sixteen-faced. One history mentions that Ram Singh&amp;#39;s army fought in 72 Buddha boats at the Battle of Saraighat, and it is also said that so many boats were operated on the waters of the Brahmaputra There was no room to move the boat. During this war, boat bridges were built over the river to cross the Brahmaputra. Although the exact number of Assamese boats in Guwahati cannot be determined, it can be assumed that their number was sufficiently large. There were many boat yards in Assam and boat building technology was well developed. There were two specific games for building and sailing boats, the boating game and the boating game. Boat wood was obtained from trees in the forests of Assam. Therefore, a strong and abundant boat fleet was created in Assam. The historian Chihabuddin Talis, who accompanied Mir Jumla, says that there were many boats, both large and small, in Assam. Once a Guwahati news writer said that as of the date of writing in the month of Ramadan, 32 Bachari and Kocha boats have reached or passed through the place. 141 Before the war against the Mughals, the Ahoms understood the need to be equipped for a long battle. We will know this from the advice given by Mr. Buragohain</content>

It will be very difficult if there is a shortage of equipment I can escape.” The Ahoms could predict all future problems with their practical intelligence and therefore could use all the resources available in the country to prepare for war. 142 When he invaded Assam, Nawab Mir Jumla had more equipment than King Ram Singh. The Nawab benefited from the weapons brought for the campaign against Suja, as this campaign was very necessary for Emperor Aurangzeb. The operation to expel Suja, who had fled to the state of Arakan, had to be suspended for a few days. Use all the weapons and equipment reserved for this operation during the invasion of Kochbehar and Assam became. Nawab Mir Jumla had all the equipment of the country as a thief of many. Ram Singh, however, had to rely on the favors and facilities of Mir Jumla&amp;#39;s next subedar, Nawar Haista-kha. Mir Jumla had a state all over India about his wealth. He was known as the richest man in the South, and he owned a hundred tons of diamonds. In addition to the money the emperor had peacocked, Mir Jumla could fight at the expense of his own treasury. .

<content>Lachit Barphukan is seen. Mir Jumla was born in the city of Ishpahan in Parya. He began his career as an ordinary fortune-teller, and eventually earned the wealth and glory of a sultan. Ram Singh grew up in the shadow of his well-known father Mirzaranja 380 Jai Singh ; Therefore, he did not need to practice and acquire the qualities of Mir Jumla, the ability to take action on his own, the ability to take advantage of environmental conditions and the ability to perform fearless tasks. Ram Singh was of moderate intelligence, and his qualities were gentle, polite and mental. Ipone Mir Jumla&amp;#39;s qualities were enterprise, progress, and an effective approach conducive to innovation. Foreign troops always faced difficulties when they invaded Assam from Bengal. The Assamese, however, were able to conduct the war very smoothly and conveniently. Lachit Barphukan once said, “If we stay in Guwahati, we can fight like we are at home.” The invaders always had to sail north against strong currents. They could only move very slowly. If their number of boats was insufficient, the equipment needed for the Assam war was also posted. The boats had to be hauled up and a large number of men had to be employed. The infantry also had to cut their way through dense forests, tall pipes and caves. It took many days for the ink and tools to reach Assam from Bengal. In 1824, the East India Company realized the advantages of the Dhakka people south of the Brahmaputra. Then Burma The soldiers were in Guwahati. The company made 20 or</content>

Charles Stewart, the historian of Bengal, summed up the Mughal experience during Mir Jumla&amp;#39;s invasion, &amp;quot;He found this description in contemporary Persian history. Charles Stewart said, &amp;quot;Mir Jumla resolved to advance by keeping an eye on the boat, for there he had all his equipment stored. So he reached the bank of the Brahmaputra, cut his way slowly near Rangamati, and began to advance gradually The soldiers had to cross the river and climb the mountains at Kera. They could not advance more than a mile or a mile a day. Like Mir Jumla, Ram Singh experienced this laborious expedition received the following. The Mughal soldiers suffered from various diseases due to the unhealthy air and water in Assam. Many soldiers suffered and died. The Assamese also fought the Battle of Daga and lost many Mughal soldiers. The Mughals were unfamiliar with the character of the Assamese and therefore received no signs of the Assamese&amp;#39;s tactics. Rangal suffered from the unexpected rains, inaccessible mountains, pidni and thick deer. Say these things and see them</content>

<content>Lachit Barfukan Chihabuddin Talis continues to describe. The following are some of the details of Mirjumla&amp;#39;s expedition. 144 (1) “Assam is a dangerous country. (2) &amp;quot;The streets of Assam are as terrible as the road to the brink of death. This country is deadly like a deserted city. Its forests are violent like the heart of the ignorant. . . . . (3) &amp;quot;Stay away from the river. Its water is favorable for the inhabitants, but it is very poisonous for the foreigners. It rains for eight months, even four months in winter. Foreigners are more likely to get sick than residents due to yellow water in summer.” (4) &amp;quot;The air and water of the mountains are poisonous to foreigners and inhabitants like the destructive Chi Rajah. (5) &amp;quot;In the past no foreign king has conquered this land, and no foreigner has trampled it under foot. No. Foreigners enter. Or the way to escape is very narrow. (6) “In short, the Somora Pratirahini Syai had to say goodbye to the kingdom of life in this country, every merchant procession that entered this country had to leave packages on the verge of death.”</content>

<content>Lachit Barphukan (7) &amp;quot;People who came here could never return like visitors to the kingdom of death, and foreigners never knew about the customs of the inhabitants of this country The people of Hindustan say that those who are in Assam are overwhelmed by magic and are unable to leave the country.” 146 (8) &amp;quot;If anyone left the camp, he was sure to be killed by the Assamese. This situation had never happened in the history of Delhi. Twelve thousand cavalry and numerous infantry were trapped here for six months The princes were looking at the cup of Delhi with satisfied eyes, and the soldiers were eager to go with the children.” (1) &amp;quot;At the beginning of the battle Diler had 1,500 horsemen at Khar Kauj; at the end of the rainy season and after the Namrup campaign, his army numbered only four hundred or five hundred. Such opinions can also be found in the letters sent by Ram Singh and his companions from Assam. · Fortunately, these letters have not yet come to light.

<content>Lachit Barphukan The forts surrounding Guwahati served as an impenetrable wall for the preservation of the Assamese. They were eaten on the tops of the mountains and in the south and in the forts between the two mountains. The land was divided into four divisions, each division having a commander with an army and some spies. well pom chase of the enemy&amp;#39;s movements was, and arrangements were made to give restrictions wherever the forest was was. If any part of the fort was broken, the post was immediately repaired. The fort around Guwahati was called Debrosargam built by Vishwakarma by the Assamese. There are many sources of information about the city of Guwahati, including the city of Guwahati, which is the capital of the state of Guwahati. ● 147 Ram Singh acknowledged that it was difficult to attack the Assamese, and he described the forts of Assam as mechanical. Ram Singh once said to Rashid-Kha, &amp;quot;The Ahoms have built forts on the hills, and the plains below. They are steep and useless for war. For this reason no foreigner has been able to conquer Assam in battle Their ministers, commanders and infantry should be commended for building such an impenetrable fortress.” When Emperor Aurangzeb took charge of sealing the battle curb, King Ram Singh said, &amp;quot;I have not neglected, but all my efforts have failed. There is no equal strength, so it is impossible to fight with shields, sticks and friends. We know that Ramsingh in Panirudha</content>

<content>Lachit Barphukan&amp;#39;s army dispersed, and the battle ended there. Before leaving Assam, King Ram Singh visited the Hoygri Temple in Hajo. Ram Singh lamented to the Brahmins of Hajo that he had not benefited from the extraordinary bravery of Lachit Barphukan and the mechanical fort of Assam. 148 Only in the open field in front of the Alabai hill did Ramsingh&amp;#39;s cavalry have once an opportunity to show their strength. Ten thousand Assamese soldiers lost their lives in the Battle of Alabai within a day. Thus, having won only once, Ram Singh, excited, said,—“So brave of Assam, come to fight in the field with the Chewari of Amber !” The Ahom did not want to face the enemy in the open field because their infantry was always afraid of cavalry attack. This is what we are after Chihabuddin Valis If ever a Mughal cavalry attacks an Andhra-wearing Assamese, they drop their weapons and run, if they cannot escape, they allow them to capture their hands and beards If the Assamese meets the Muslim infantry, he fearlessly tries to kill them, and succeeds?” After the Battle of Alabai, Ram Singh did not have a second chance to engage his cavalry.

<content>Lachit Barphukan knew that once the enemy cavalry entered the plains of Guwahati, it would not be easy to thwart their attack. Ramringha also suffered from the lack of a faithful and skilled commander. His sixth commander proved to be rebellious and unfaithful. There was also suspicion that Rashid-Khai had secretly allied himself with the Assamese. Diler-b. Had Ram Singh been with a skilled general like Daudjai, the cycle of events would have turned out differently. Mir Jumla was able to capture the skyscraper of Shimlugarh thanks to the extraordinary courage of Diler-Khan. The siege of this fort was beyond the power of even the most skilled generals. In the Machir-ul-Tamba, Diler-Khan, the commander of Mir Jumla&amp;#39;s advance army, is described as a companion of the victory. The book also says, &amp;quot;Under the influence of the auspicious signs of time and the planets, Diler rose to the peak of fortune from the beginning of his life. According to the government of Har Basna, in the campaign against Shivaji—&amp;quot;Diner-b sat like lightning-grave in front of each other&amp;#39;s forts.

<content>Lachit Barphukan used diplomatic means — Sam, Dan and Bhed From time to time, he resorted to both war and diplomacy when necessary. He learned these methods well from his father Mirza Raja Jai Singh. 150 During the war against Shivaji, Jai Singh sent letters to several kings of the South, inciting them to take up arms against the leader of Maharashtra. Many kings and zamindars sent envoys to Jai Singh promising to side with the Mughals. Everyone who had a grudge against Shivaji, and who was jealous of the reputation of the Bhenchlas, was met by King Jai Singh&amp;#39;s spies, and several leaders, including Fazal Khan, son of Afzal-Kha, served as commanders under Jai Singh. Jai Singh also tried to create rebellion among Shivaji&amp;#39;s officers by luring them with money and gold and promising them high positions under the Mughals. This caused several of Shivaji&amp;#39;s generals and tributary kings to move out of Jai Singh. A Maharashtra historian says, &amp;quot;We have ample evidence that Jai Singh tried to create divisions among Shivaji&amp;#39;s loyalists. We can certainly see from a letter to Aurangzeb that Jai Singh took a discriminatory approach. A relative of Chandrarao More, a son of Afzal-Khab and a Muslim employee who made guns for Shirazi and Shivaji&amp;#39;s followers were invited by Jai Singh to give manachar. This diplomacy was arranged as a collaborative approach to the end of the war. Shivajvir submitted in the hope of a high military rank and the assurance of friendship and restoration of possibility with the Emperor.</content>

<content>Lachit Barphukan A year later, Jai Singh&amp;#39;s son Ram Singh sent a letter to his son Lachit Barphukan seeking the boundaries defined by Momai-Bhamuli Rabarua. Ram Singh reminded Lachit of the need to be loyal to his father Ram Singh explained that if Barphukan followed the previous article, he would be like a gold and silver principle for ever shall his glory be He will live forever. The Assamese generals laughed at this charge and called it Sai-Ali. They said that no article could be valid without the consent of Swargadeo, and that articles made by Ram Singh without the consent of Emperor Aurangzeb There is no determination. Attempts to resolve the issue through peaceful negotiations without fighting. The Assamese condemned the king in battle. They explained that Ram Singh was a great warrior, sent to Assam only to prove his prowess, and belonged to Assam without victory If he goes back, his reputation will be shattered. 151 Ram Singh repeatedly tried to bribe Lachit Barphukan and his officers with money and gold. Barfukan did not allow the enemy to bring a single wooden bird, so it is unbelievable that Barfukan&amp;#39;s men accepted gifts of money and gold. Bhakatdah Katangi wanted to take Churamani Dairaj away to Ramsingh. Therefore, it is important to understand the importance of these issues.

<content>Lachit Barphukan and his enemies are influenced by Hindu ideals. Therefore, Ram Singh used Hindu language in his proposals. He once told an Assamese Katki, “If I want more, the sword in my hand will keep me, and the necklace around my neck will leave me forever, and my fourteen years will fall into hell I am happy to take away my proposal and I am willing to give him whatever he wants.” Ram Singh said once more, &amp;quot;I will send some money to give to the Fukans and the Rajkhowas. Let them persuade Fukans to leave Guwahati. I will do whatever they tell me to do. The Rajput generals&amp;#39; attempts to seduce them seemed to fall on deaf ears, and the generals of Assam remained steadfast in their promise to destroy the enemy. Ram Singh tried to create distrust and division among the Assamese soldiers against Lachit Barphukan. He sent arrows to the fortresses of the Assamese generals. A nest box was stuffed with leaves and tied before an arrow. Ram Singh once sent a letter to the court of Miri-Sandiky Fukan. There was some disagreement between Barfukan and Sandiky Fukan. The letter was addressed to Barfukan. The letter read, &amp;quot;Nabar, yesterday you belonged to us!

<content>Lachit Barphukan 154 wanted to do, and the Ahom general Buragohai also wanted to get Fuknelg. The first impression was rejected by Bargade, saying, &amp;quot;Ram Singh is an ordinary servant, not an independent king with an umbrella. Therefore, it is necessary to send a thousand soldiers instead of me, who will go and grind the king&amp;#39;s sword into dough. Ram Singh&amp;#39;s proposals for a peaceful settlement The Assamese thus rejected it with ridicule. Ram Singh was unsuccessful in taking any advantage against the Assamese, whether in war or diplomacy. Nowhere in the history of the world do we find an example of fighting without any difficulties, except in Hitler&amp;#39;s method of sudden attack. Nature gives Or no enemy army has been able to enter another country without facing man-made obstacles and obstacles. We judge the amount of tactics and courage of a commander according to his strength to overcome difficulties. Whatever the reason, Ram Singh himself admitted that he had no advantage in the Assam War. This is evidence of his lack of present intelligence and ability, and evidence of the wise organizational strength and leadership of the Assamese The forts of Guwahati, the air and water of Assam and other natural conditions were the fortified walls of protection of this country.

<content>Lachit Barphukan 155 could not be disturbed and destroyed by the wealth of Anber or the diplomacy of the Rajpus. Their minds were like walls built of hard stone, and to extend this metaphor, when the enemy&amp;#39;s bullets fell on the fortress and bushes, there was a little dust flying, and there was no sign of the walls being broken down. The example of the leaders was the cause of this invincible attitude. The heavens were determined to win the battle, and the generals. This is the attitude was inspired. Swargade controlled the commander and encouraged him to work quickly. Therefore, it is important to note that the present study is not only a study of the characteristics of the country&amp;#39;s economy, but also of the characteristics of the country&amp;#39;s economy. There was no feeling of displeasure or dissatisfaction among the upper-class commanders, they worked for one purpose—“the victory of the Assamese army.” In pursuing this purpose, they are their ego. They completely rejected the idea. Their attitude was also felt by the subordinate commanders, and the commanders created this burden in the hearts of their soldiers and their companions. Therefore, it is important to understand the importance of these issues. Therefore, it is important to understand the importance of these issues. This scene was a picture for the gods to see. And for the Assamese, this scene is the indigenous seedbed of inspiration for the rehabilitation and development of the country. In the battle on this side, the Assamese gave good proof of their strength by quickly recovering from their burdens in case of danger.

In addition, work had to be done to restore national dignity, build the people&amp;#39;s confidence in the sovereignty of the country and in themselves, and replace their defeatist attitude with a victorious one. Jaidhwaj Singh Maharaj concentrated on restoring the kingdom with the same enthusiasm and vision with which he had liberated Kamrup from the Mughals and conquered the kingdom as far as near Dhaka. The letters of Swargade to the kings of Kochbehar, Jaintia and Nartangia show his determination to fight the Mughals again.

After the Treaty of Ghilawarighat, His Majesty Jaidhwaj Singh lived only for a month, and he constantly shed tears for the plight of Assam in his day. From his deathbed words we learn of the innermost grief of the late Swargadeo.—“Try as much as you can to pluck the mother shell out of our chests by the Bengal enemy.” Sab Swargade Chakradhar Singh was not the kind of man who would sit back and watch the plight of the country. Assam has always caused Bengal to go to war, with the exception of the plight of Sheva during the reign of Mijumla.

There are many ways to get a job, but the most important thing is to get a job. Advancing somewhat in the preparations for the war, Swargade wrote again to the king, “Shall we not try to remove the subjugation of Bengal, saying that the Mughals have once defeated us”? Shivaji defeated the Mughals and sent them on a twenty-day journey, and Swargade Chakradhar Singh was also inspired by this message. For Jaidhwaj Singh and Chakradhar Singh Swargadeo, the plight of Mir Jumla&amp;#39;s invasion only fueled new initiatives, organization and exertion of all forces. The potential of this new approach was not only in people and equipment, but also in the possibility of awakening the inherent patriotism and lost strength of the Assamese. 157 In the past, the Assamese knew that their manpower and equipment were resources of finance, and that these resources had to be mobilized to achieve a purpose. Therefore, it is necessary to take measures to ensure that these resources are used effectively through the tireless efforts of selfish and patriotic leaders They rightly believed. The reason for the defeat of the Assamese at the hands of Mir Jumla in the days of Jaidhwaj Singh Swargadev was the powerful Netab Over, although the equipment of war was insufficient.

They were as strong as the eyes in the bringing of the revolution No one can surpass them, like the Arga-giant Injit, whose hair rises when they see them An animal that escapes from the captivity of a prisoner. During the Man invasion, the famous general of Avar, Kiramidi Bargohai, was surprised by the fighting strength of the Assamese army. Firamidi believed that the Assamese had lost the battle due to lack of a suitable commander. In February 1819, when the Assamese army was defeated at the Battle of Phulpanisiga, Kiabisi told his Man ally Momai Barua, “You have many warriors in your country, but you do not have a good commander, so we were able to defeat them”. Even now, the son-in-law resources of Assam have not been used properly due to lack of leaders. But what qualities are needed to be an effective leader?

Wouldn&amp;#39;t we try to throw away the Mughal submission once they defeated us? Yogal has defeated us once, we have defeated the Mughals repeatedly.)

Your sister-in-law should be given only if you have no daughter. You think you will express your joy like this, and you say, “We are ready to send the man through the fig tree, but we are waiting for your word.” “You know that we have never known the army in any particular way.

Therefore, it is important to understand the importance of these issues. 58 (18) From Lachit Barphukan, the commander of the army of Assam, to King Ram Singh, son of Mirza Baja, 1591 Shak. The message you sent to Chatua and Abahalla Then the alliance will remain. My father Barbarossa made a love affair with Alair-ri. It&amp;#39;s a drag. Today, it is being published in moderation. If you can do that, your our fame will sit like the moon and the sun. And if you send the scholars to the bridge you want. What else can I write? You are the son of Jai Singh, the ruler of exploration, and the grandson of the king&amp;#39;s mother tongue. The love that is accepted with such a woman is accomplished only by cover and proper behavior, not otherwise. Other news in our place is told by Srinarayan and Ramacharan. Then the message was seen (19) from the Mughal general Raja Ram Singh to the Assamese general Lachit Barphukan. Shak 1590. &amp;quot;I have sent Pandit Rai and Karisekhar to your place. Now I have often asked for proof of your love for us. Only then will the Gobrahmans be saved. What we write is always obeyed, rarely. Otherwise it will not happen. 20. From Lachit Barphukan, the general of Assam, to Ram Singh, the general of the Mughals. Shaka 1591. &amp;quot;I have sent back Pandit Rai and Karisekhar. You speak of love, but you have not remembered what happened in the past.

<content>Lachit Barphukan said to Madharcharan, &amp;quot;Madhavachasan Kaupatia has repeatedly sent for a lawyer, but I find no evidence of love. Talk of peace with your mouth, but do not stop preparing war at the same time. 21. From the weak Mughal general Rahid-Bir to Lachit Barphukan, the general of Assam, 1592 AD. &amp;quot;I came to Assam with the Khankhana Nawab and Diler-khi in the past. And now, by order of the Padshah, I have come with Ram Singh. Note :—Nawab Mirmala appointed Rahid-Khan as Fauzadar of Guwahati, after whom Firoz-Dhan became Fauzadar. He came to Assam with Rashiy-Khan Ram Singh as a weak general. An old Assamese history says that the above letter was sent by Rahid-Khan to Barphukan without Ram Singh&amp;#39;s permission. Ram Singh issued a receipt for this purpose This letter was tied in a sling and sent out of Assam by arrows. There, the Parias took it and gave it to Lachit Barphukan. As a peace for this crime, Ram Singh cut off the ropes of Rahid-Khir Tamighar at the hands of his fellow Rajputs. Ram Singh also held Rambid-thak responsible for unnecessarily stirring up trouble. Rahid-kha Bhatia, pleased with these two things, said, &amp;quot;If I catch Ram Singh, the Pathans and Rajputs with him will defeat me and Padasta will be angry. 188. 188</content>

<content>The Archaeological Department of Assam in 1964 obtained an old Assamese manuscript entitled &amp;#39;The Story of the Battle of Ram Singh&amp;#39; from Mr. Nagendra Nath Gogoi, a resident of Chekopar village near Shibsagar town. They get the earth. This is the story of Ram Singh There are accounts of events witnessed by the writers themselves. There are two signs of the constellations Iav and Churamani and Sarodh. There is special mention of the words and deeds of the fortune tellers. They both participated in the conduct of the war as fortune-tellers, although not as warriors. The 11th day of the month of Chat, 1590, is the date of the departure of the Saikhs of Assam from the nearby Manahandi. The language of the history is ancient and difficult Assamese, and its text is distorted, occasionally missing, and difficult to recover. The original Sanskrit verses uttered by Churamani Gaivajna in support of his calculations are quoted in the history. The general reader will find it difficult to follow the sequence of events and to make sense of some events. There are many different types of characters in the film, but the most important one is the character of Lachit Barphukan. However, only what can be determined with certainty is included here. There are 28 leaves in the page. The number of backs is in two stages,—the first stage from the first to the seventh leaf, and the second stage from the 3rd to the 20th leaf. Similarly, from leaf 3 to leaf 2 we have only two leaves, of course the included leaves are not exactly the same. The text of the first seven pages was confirmed by a guess; And the second stage, from leaf 3 to pad 20, is the first</content>

<content>The Lachit Barphukan stage matches leaves 1 to 7, although there are occasional movements of the text. We called these two lessons the first lesson and the second lesson. The following are some statements to introduce the method and concept of historical narrative. There are many examples of these characters in the history of Assam There is support to think that the name Samudra Churamani was the title of Achyutananda Dolay. 190 (1) Barphukan said to Samudra Churamani the fortune teller,—&amp;quot;Count and see: tell me who will lose and who will win, when the battle will be fought, and when the enemy will be defeated. Page 2, Lesson I. &amp;quot;The battle will start on the 8th day of Bahar, and the battle will be fought on the 11th day. The outcome of this battle will be good for us. But one of our commanders will die. Leaf 2, First Lesson. (3) The minister of the vessels held a meeting, and the king asked them to go to Varna. The Fukans said to Swargadeo : &amp;quot;We don&amp;#39;t need any other counters, we need these Hujans of Churamani and Sarovar. The king said, “Well, let the counters go, and when they come back I will give them elephants as gifts.” Page 3, Lesson I. (4) People said that many reds were coming. One day Barphukan climbed onto the fort and saw the Bengalis, and asked others to climb and look. Therefore, it is important to understand the importance of these issues. He thought to himself, &amp;quot;This is what happened to me in Fukan&amp;#39;s day. How will my king be saved? How will my kingdom be saved? How will it be saved later?&amp;quot; Page 7, Lesson 1, Leaf 6, Lesson (5) The heavenly being said:</content>

When will there be battle, who will fight, and who will win?&amp;quot; Therefore, it is important to note that the present study is not limited to the field of physics, but also includes the field of biology, chemistry, and physics-based research. No. Leaf, Second Lesson. (7) &amp;quot;That night Fukan had a dream. In the morning we Fukan told Baharia, Churmani, Sarobar and Mahai about the dream. Leaf 6, Lesson II. (8) Sakangana Fukan Lachit said: &amp;quot;Everyone listen carefully. I will cut off anyone who releases water with this hammer immediately. 11th leaf. &amp;quot;It&amp;#39;s nice to see when the flowers bloom, but when they fall off, they fall together in the morning. I&amp;#39;ll write when I see them. 11th leaf. (10) &amp;quot;And in a water battle we two were very frightened. We asked the captain of a warboat to cross the river. On our way to the north bank, the Bengalis caught us in the middle of the river There are many ways to get a job, but the most important thing is to get a job that is worth your time and effort.

<content>They began to take the name of Lachit Barphukan. There are 19 times that Oli has been involved, only one of which has been Nagali.” (11) Hearing this incident, Barfukan became angry with us and asked who had let us board the warship, saying, “If the people die, we will have no help, their mathematics is our main strength.” Churamani said,—&amp;quot;People died in the battle of Naaman in the Mahabharata, and it was not known who died where. 12. Bhakatdas and Dhuli These two Katkis were coming and going from the Ahom outside to the Mughal outside. What is the strategy of the Ahom? Who is their chief?” There is a Burhagohai named Rupaswarga [Kanka Atan] and a Barphukan named Lachit. With these Nawabs there is a fortune teller named Churamani. He looks at the Scriptures and counts and sends soldiers into battle without knowing what defeat is. Your dreams of victory in the face of such invincible heroes are all false.” :6-17. (13) Bhakatdah says,— “Churamani, hearing of your fame, Ramsingh has asked me to take you to him for proof. They have also offered to give him Rs. 10,000 as a gift.” I heard Katki say to myself, “If I go, they will arrest me for harming the Bengalis. Therefore, it is necessary to take action against these people. Therefore, it is necessary to take action against these people.

Then Shubhdah decided to take him away to Ram Singh. (14) “I have heard the story of Chosh. That&amp;#39;s the end of this. Then, in the month of Bhad, 1591, King Chakrabbaj Singh became Shatak, that is, heavenly.” 8th Pad.</content>

<content>Lachit Barphukan (15) The ministers of Assam began to fear victory, and they secretly discussed, &amp;quot;If we leave the fortress and fight in the plains, we will kill them Balpati, we are not good at ground warfare. The priest brought the bridegroom secretly, but did not tell anyone. 18th leaf. (16) Then Charidia Fukan stretched out his hand and said, &amp;quot;I will answer it. Tell me what Sarbobash and Chutamdhi have to do. The Supreme Personality of Godhead said to the prisoner, &amp;quot;I will now speak of the danger of war between sages, Kshatriyas and Bahuvas. This is followed by the Sanskrit verse. 18-19 leaves. (17) Fukan found proof of the mathematics of the fortune teller, and found no discrepancy anywhere. Fukan praised him and said, &amp;quot;Blessed is Churamani, he has put all the weapons of war in his hands. Leaf 21. The following can be inferred from the history of the Battle of Ram Singh. (1) The reason why the pot-ministers sent the signs to the fortune tellers of Churamani and Sarovar except other astrologers is that they came to be the best in astrology. Captain Thomas Wells, Sir, said in 1794 : &amp;quot;These pot-ministers consisted of three! Gohais and two ministers. The three na Gohais or pots were the Barpatra Gohai, the Bargohai and the Buragohai They were able to hold their advice and support in all matters of their dignity, and if they were proved incompetent or seriously guilty</content>

<content>The ministers mentioned by Captain Wells are Barrakara and Barphukan. During the war of Ram Singh, fairs of ministers were frequently held in Guwahati to decide the course of action (2) Of these two fortune-tellers, Churamani was more scholarly and industrious than Sarosh, as evidenced by Lachit Fukan&amp;#39;s praise of Churamani and Ramsingh&amp;#39;s attempts to seduce him (4) The use of the first inflection in the narrative suggests that Churamani himself was a narrator and a historian He was known as Samudra Churamani Dalai in the first lesson. In the second lesson he is referred to only as Churamani In the history found in the Mahant&amp;#39;s house, a fortune teller named Achutananda Dolai was particularly associated with the Battle of Saraighat Therefore, it is necessary to take into consideration the following factors: After a while, Achutananda Dolai announced that Shubrun had arrived to kill Khenhi, and the Assamese defeated Ram Singh in battle.</content>

<content>Lachit Barphukan Swargade gave Achutananda financial awards and vehicles, and gave him the title of Sandhavari, because the battle was fought on water. The Assamese also called the Puris seas, namely; Jaisagar, Shibsagar, Gauri Sagar. There is no mention of any other fortune teller about the Battle of Saraighat in the history found in the house of Sukumar Mahant. The descendants of the sea urchin also call their families the descendants of the sea urchin There are a few pages at the end of Sukumar Mahant&amp;#39;s Buranjiprithi that contain some information about the royal Rab of the fortune tellers. This is included in the Dewai Assam Buranji, so it is not included in the published edition of Sukumar Mahattar Buranji. In these pages, he describes the part played by fate in the Assam-Yogal war. Initially, the fortune-tellers were associated with the heavenly gods. There was an educated fate with the officers in the south of Pachai. The fortune tellers had to calculate whether the Ahom soldiers would win or lose. Thus the scientists became Aryans in the place of various officers. 1539 Shakta Pratap Singh, Bargade sent two fortune-tellers named Nahar and Phalia to the battle of Chamghara. The Ahom army won the battle at Ganitasha of Dairanj. They chatted· that everyone would obey the fortune tellers. They were appointed as good looking daibs with different Ahom caucuses in battles including Mira, Ramsingh and Marchu. During the invasion of Mirbhusala, Swargade Jayadeva allowed Virat and Chabaz to stay with the soldiers. During the Battle of Ram Singh, Swargade Chakraj Singh placed Safawa, Ramkhabi and Kavi Saraswati with the generals of Guwahati. During Mansur-kha, he gave Virat to Lal Basgohain; He gave Sahadhari and Jyotitva to Ran to Barphukan of Chetia Bagar; and he gave Bamkhabi to Deccan the son of Pichai; They gave Nitai of Bharual to Chashijia Fukan : Nahar and Bishadhabi to Buragohai; Ank gave it to Palin ; Faluk gave Chotra to walk; and gave the narrator to the Fukan of Namandia. After a few days, Ganja Sandiky brought that Guwahati is a border area and there should be good fortune-tellers here; Therefore</content>

<content>These fortune-tellers were allowed to stay in Guwahati by Swargade Padabansingh, Nahar, Kangia, Dakwal, Jyotitvarshan and Ramkhari. Therefore, it is important to note that the present study is not a comprehensive study of the effects of physical activity on the development of the brain. Under Bardoli were eleven Patidolis of the Daivajna family, Rupau, Bharual, Nahar, Ramkhabi, Kakhari, Nibhai, Roumaria, Uzir, Dharmashil, Virat and Vishayakhabi. Therefore, it is important to note that the present study is not limited to the field of physics, but also includes the field of biology, chemistry, and psychology. Therefore, it is necessary to take into consideration the following factors: After the Battle of Saraighat, Lachit Barphukan extended the borders of Assam to the Manaha River. The king gave him the title of Samudrakhari: a pair of gamkhas, golden salt and a daughter of the gosai of Aldibari in Kamrup, and gave him one hundred and twenty houses as dowry. Eleven They made Patidolai Bardolai. There are many ways in which you can improve your self-confidence. There are many ways in which you can improve your self-confidence. The Sathi-Sabhati of Achyutananda Dolay can still be found in the village of Kurua, north of Owahati. Achyutananda is a learned scholar. According to Mr. Kirtinath Bardoloi, Achyutananda wrote several astrological books in Sanskrit such as Horaghrita, Trisira, etc. He also wrote several poems in Assamese. The killing of Kurmarani, the killing of Abasura, Bali-gunjira and Vyasanjam. It is worth mentioning that the author of Sandeepika is the seventh generation of Arttan from Achutananda Doli. For example, from the above-mentioned history, it is inferred that the man called Churamani or Samudra Churamani the fortune teller was none other than Achutananda Dolai, and that Achutananda Dolai was called Churamani for other astrologers before Swargade Udayadhitya Singh gave him the name Samuvakhari. and as a doer he was named doing Saraswati. The name dust is used in many swajas.</content>

<content>The author of the verse history &amp;#39;Lachit Barphukan Banshavali&amp;#39; was a fortune teller, but he is better known as Suryadhari fortune teller, whose name seems to have been forgotten. The Assam Buranji, found in the house of Sukumar Mahatta, gives prominence to the actions and words of Achyutananda Dolay, and the description is as straightforward as one sees it with one&amp;#39;s own eyes. For these reasons, I have the impression that the Burvi was compiled by Achutananda Dolay himself. But to convert this hypothesis into an irrefutable proof requires more proof. The fortune tellers of Assam have made many contributions to the development of the motherland, especially in the fields of vision and politics. Among them are: Sridbrata Madhavachandra Bardoli ; Malbhag Baroua, a survivor of a pioneering tea farming family; Badhanath Chankakati, son of the Chakra family, founder of the Ganini English newspaper Time of Asar; There are many ways to get a job in the field of IT , but the most important thing is to get a job in the field of IT There are many ways in which you can improve your self-confidence.
