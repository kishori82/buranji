<content>Chutia State The Chutia are now Assamese. A community of nations. They once had their own kingdom and king, and their king reigned in glory for more than three hundred years. Their victory-flag They flew to the kingdom of Gaur. Javi They once ruled in Assam. They belong to other backward classes like Ahom, Koch, Maran etc. Short Who wrote their history in their own language No evidence is available. When they established the kingdom in Assam, there was no custom of writing history in Assam. They are the first to become part of the Ahom history. They are the first to become part of the Ahom history. They are collected by the Ahoms as written history, excluding folklore It’s shorter than history Something can be learned about the race. According to him, Birpala of the Bhishma dynasty was the first Raj of the Chutiyas in the twelfth century. . A genealogy of their kings The collected history is dated Shaka The Ahom own roots in the history of the language short.all tour They say the nation. I don&amp;#39;t think there has been much research on the history of the Chutia. It is not known where their monuments are within the boundaries of the Chutia kingdom. The names of the places where they were Buddhas with the Ahoms are now known as where and what There is no guarantee. They&amp;#39;re the ones</content>

<content>The Chutia kingdom was inhabited by mountains such as Sonagiri, Bangalgiri, Nilgiri, Chandragiri or Chalangiri, which seem to be at the mouth of the Sovanshiri river; But no one has come out to tell us what those mountains are now known by. The boundaries of their kingdom are also exactly people. It doesn&amp;#39;t go. Give an overview of the Chutia caste based on information found in published histories, reports, articles, district gazetteers etc. Hall:Colonel LW Shakespear, Mr. According to Endle and Sibsagar District Gagelteer, Chutiabil/k is a Boro people. Mr. According to Mr. Endle, the Ravas, Garos, Marans, Mechs, Dhimals, Kochs, Solanimias, Mohlias, Phulguris of Assam. Sharania, Dimas (Kachari), Hojai, Lalung, Hajong. They belong to the Boro ethnic group. There are many In the prehistoric period of Assam, the Kacharis spread throughout the Assam Valley and established kingdoms in places. The Kachar District Gazetteer states that the Kacharis came from Indo-Chinese and from the area between the Yangtze and Huangho rivers. The former Sub-Divisional Magistrate of North Kachar, Mr. According to Dundas, the Kacharis (Brahmaputra) and the Chagi rivers flowed left and water reached the Nilachal Mountains in Kamrup and from there came to Dimapur. Mr. Fisher says that the Kacharis of Kachar once ruled in Kamrup and their dynasty is descended from King Hachuncha. Mr. Mr. Risley says that according to the light legend, in producing the human race One of the worshipers performed Ras in Kachar country. According to the Nepalis, the country is located at the foot of the mountains between the Brahmaputra and Kushi rivers. From him descended the Koch, Mech and Dhimal races. Mr. Mr. Risley says “Kachar”. The territory was given to Mr. Mr. Brian. Hodgson and Colonel Shakespear say “coach”. You lived in this “Kachar” or “Kach” country in the beginning. Therefore, its inhabitants may later be known as Kacharis. There are many different types of characters in the film and there is evidence of their existence in Sadia.

The Kacharis worship the Kechairati Gosani of Sadia. and maybe. Someone still does. In 1228 AD, the Tais came to Saura and established their empire under the Chaolod Sukapha. They are old among them. History was prevalent and we ever since They were later known as the Ahoms and their empire was named Assam by the kings of Maran and Barahi in the Brahmaputra valley, up to the mountains to the north and around Sadia to the west The Bhuiyans ruled to the eastern border of the Brahmaputra kingdom, the Kacharis to the west of the Dikhou kingdom, the Bhuiyans on the southern and southern banks of the kingdom Therefore, in 1228 AD, there were four kingdoms in the Brahmaputra valley namely Chutia, Maran and Kachari They left Dimapur in 1531 AD when the Kachari kingdom of the Dhansiri valley was annexed to the Ahom kingdom and later established the Kachari kingdom there, first establishing Maran and Barahi They conquered the kingdom and established the foundation of the Ahom Empire in Saumar</content>

<content>The kingdom of Chutia entered into marriage with them and gave subjects to many of their worthy men and included them among their own people. In about 1524 AD, the Ahoms annexed the kingdom of Chutia to their kingdom in conquering the kingdom Chaofrasemud Bargohai was appointed the first Sadiakhwa Gohai. Over time, all four of the Brahmaputra Valley The kingdom fell to the Ahom Empire. It took the Ahoms 300 years (1228 AD to 1531 AD) to accomplish this. with the Chutia and Kacharis The Ahoms married and some of them were married according to their suitability The Ahoms included them in their nation. When will the Chutia come to Assam I don&amp;#39;t know exactly where it came from. Their ancient settlement in Assam seems to have been in the southern mountains along the banks of the Sovanshiri River. The area is now part of the Suwansiri region of Nepal and the Chiang border region or the southern part of the Abar Hills. To the north of the mountains where they live are the mountains where the Miri and Aba tribes live ।। The Miri and the Aba are basically the same race. They are a Tibeto-Burman race. They’re the ones When to Assam Where&amp;#39;s the guy? It is not known whether it came. To the south of the Chutia was the kingdom of the Sadial Kacharis in the plains. Short and the Kacharis are of the Boro race as mentioned above. The Boros are Indo-Chinese. They are Yangtze and Huanghe in China They are said to have come from the middle of the river or from the northeastern region of the Brahmaputra. They probably migrated and eventually settled in the northeastern region of the Brahmaputra and later moved to the plains from there. comes down to the area. If so, then the Chutia The northeast of Assam entered Assam and performed Ras in the southern part of the Miri and Abar mountains. They probably went north from the Miri and Abar peoples. and was prevented from going south by the Sadial Kacharis. The Kachari Buranji and the Deokhai Assam Buranji mention a royal clan of the Kacharis, Sadia. This kingdom is completed in Sadia, to the west</content>

<content>The Chutia kingdom ruled between the southern bank of the Dihing in the north and the Feluguri in Delhi in the south. Give it here The northern boundary does not appear to be correct ; Because always Budhidihing which everyone calls Dihing or north of Nadihing. Many also call the Brahmaputra Dihing in the southern part. In the north, the Brahmaputra instead of the Dihing corresponds to the Rap. It is now located north of the Brahmaputra. Part of this territory falls in present-day Dibrugarh sub-division, part in Sibsagar district and part in Nagaon district. In 1750 AD, there was a great flood in Assam. The floods changed the course of the rivers in southern Assam. The present Brahmaputra flowed north of Majuli and was known as Lohit. Majuli did not exist before 1750 AD. The Dihing River then fell into the Brahmaputra south of Habung. His Majesty Tyao Tham Thi (1380-89 AD) handed over the kingdom to Bakunwari He went to invade the kingdom. Therefore, it is necessary to take advantage of the absence of the heavenly gods. Miss the little princess There is an Assamese history that he was executed by taking out the cell. This is rarely supported in the original Tai and other Assamese histories. Subject according to the said history They did not kill the little princess, but stopped her and carried her on their shoulders to the Dihing. The brow rose and fell into the harung, and a Brahmin found it and gave shelter to the little princess. The younger princess had a child and later ascended the Ahom throne in 1397 AD under the name of Bamuni Konwar alias Sudangpha. Chaolud Chukapha crossed the Dihing and established his capital at Habung in 1240 AD; But when the flood came, they left that place. This suggests that in 1240 AD Habung was under the Chutia king. Ahom history tells us that Chaolukapha conquered the Chutia kingdom once before coming to conquer Assam. The extent of the Chutia kingdom at that time is unknown. According to Sir EA Gait&amp;#39;s Assam Buranji, the Habung part of the Chutia kingdom was incorporated into the Ahom Empire in 1512 AD during the reign of His Majesty Suhumung. This shows that the Harung section was part of the Chutia kingdom for a while. It is believed that the Chutia occupied Habung after Chaulud Hukafa left it. This Habung belongs to the Sovansiri and Lohit</content>

<content>The Chutia kingdom must be located in the northeast corner of the confluence. In the floods of 1750 AD, the Bahmaputra left the Red Stream and flowed south to form the Dihing Jaru Dikhou River to form Majuli. In Shivsagar, the Brahmaputra is still called Dihing by many. It is believed that before 1750 AD, Dikhou in Shivsagar sub-division, Tuni in Majuli and Kalang in Nagaon were a river. Based on this hypothesis, it is said that the Rahmaputra divides the river into three parts and different angles became known by different names in different regions. The Kalang River and the Tuni River are now the tributaries of the Brahmaputra. The Kalang River joins the Kapili River at Jagi Bhakat village in Nagaon and flows into the Brahmaputra at Kajlimukh These are the words. I guess it&amp;#39;s always The Kachari kingdom of the Rajfai tribe is located on the southern bank of the Buhmputra The mascara extended to the face. When is this kingdom It is not known when it was established and destroyed. Chaolung s cuff There are many sources of information about the Kachari kingdom of Dimapur They were able to reach the kingdoms of Maran and Barahi to the east of Nagaon. north of the Brahmaputra When was the Kachari kingdom in this section up to the mountains It doesn&amp;#39;t go; But this is it It is certain that this section was once under the Kacharis. It is possible that the Chutiyas took advantage of the breakup of the Kachari kingdom of this region and established their kingdoms there. 1 It is said that a cat was born from Sadashiva in the womb of the wife of a Kachari named Manik of Sadia. The cat was buried in the soybean field and became a golden cat. The golden cat where Manik mentioned above always He received the kingdom and handed it over to his son-in-law Mukuta along with the golden cat. Deodhai Assam History records that Birpal of the Bhishmok (Bhishmak) dynasty ruled over 60 houses of Chutia on the Sonagiri hill in 1111 Shaka (1189 AD). and took the name of Gayapal. Kubera assumed the form of Rirpal and embraced his wife Rupavati, and Gaurinarayana was born. In his dream, Kurer told Birpal that he dug at the root of a tree and found a sun, a sword and a golden cat. Deodhai</content>

The cowboys acted accordingly, the charst two They found a golden cat and a staff. They are used to keep mosquitoes Then Raj Hai Khushu Raj. He didn&amp;#39;t take the name. Now the Kachari Bazar clan of Sadia is as short as a golden cat The king also had a golden cat. Both There is talk among them that there is a golden eagle in the king&amp;#39;s house. Doesn&amp;#39;t it mean having a relationship? It is not known what the former religion of the Chutia was. It is universally agreed that the Deuris were their priests. Therefore, the religion of the Deuris is the religion of the Chutia in the past. The Deuris have been worshiping Kechaikhati Gosani since ancient times. The Kacharis were also worshipers of Kechaikhati Gosani and some of them still worship Kechaikhati Gosani The Kechaikhati Temple is also called the “Tamreshwari Temple”. The temple is located eight miles northeast of Sadia on the banks of the Chalnai. The Deuris call the goddess of this temple “Peshagi&amp;quot; (Pesasi) meaning daughter. According to Lieutenant Paltan, the temple was made of rectangular stone with iron beams. They are hard on the rocks It didn&amp;#39;t happen. Its walls are 42 feet thick. Each side of the inner side of the temple was eight feet. There was a copper skin over the temple; But now the skin is broken. The temple is called Tamreshwari Temple and the goddess is called Tamar Mai because of its copper skin. The temple is surrounded by a brick wall 130 feet and 200 feet long. There is a three-legged cow stone at the entrance to the west wall. Until recently, a person was sacrificed there every year. That is why the goddess is named Kechaikhati. They were later allowed to sacrifice only those sentenced to death. Always not finding such a person from a letter determined person One a year</content>

<content>The Chutia kingdom was determined to sacrifice young men. This man&amp;#39;s house was called the house of the “flock”. The bull house received some benefits from the king. The young man who was determined to be sacrificed should be kept in the temple for a few days and not fed well do became. There was a rule that Bamuns and royalty could not be sacrificed. Women, Nihjatis and Muslim victims were considered unfit. On the appointed day, the sacrificer is dressed in beautiful clothes and gold and silver ornaments, shown to the people, and the priest secretly sacrifices him They took him to the place. Out there They didn&amp;#39;t let people go. There, the victim&amp;#39;s body ornaments were removed and sacrificed. The body of the sacrifice fell into the pool and the head was placed with the other heads in front of the temple. This practice of human sacrifice was abolished by Swargadeo Gaurinath Singh (1780–94 AD). According to the Deuris, the Ahoms lost their kingdom because they stopped human sacrifice. According to Colonel Henry, the Kechaikhati Temple was rebuilt in the 15th century, during the restoration of the Bamunia religion. He believes that the temple is made of granite and its doors are beautifully carved and have two silver teeth on the doorstep There was a large stone elephant. In the 15th century, Sadiya was under the Chutiyas. Therefore, it must be said that the temple was rebuilt in the 15th century by the Chutia king. The Kacharis worshiped Kechaikhati, suggesting that the Kechaikhati temple existed before the Chutia ruled Sadia. In the early 16th century, the Chutia kingdom fell to the Ahom Empire. His Majesty Laxmi Singh (1769-80 AD) appointed his religious guru Ramapad Acharya Na-Gosai as the principal of the Tamreshwari Temple. At present, the descendants of Na Gosai have no rights in this temple It is not that the heavenly gods did not improve this temple Now The question arises whether the temple described by Lieutenant Dalton and Colonel Haney is Kachari, Chutia Or did the Ahoms. This question is difficult to answer. Before the Ahoms built brick houses, the Kacharis built brick houses in Dimapur. The Tamreshwari temple was surrounded by brick walls. Based on this, the Kacharis call themselves Kechaikhati</content>

<content>It seems to be a mistake to say that the kingdom of Futia built a temple to Gosani ; Because brick walls can be given by the heavenly gods. Captain Rowlatt&amp;#39;s 1867 Michigan expedition John from the description It is said that 24 miles north of Sadia there are two forts between the Dikrang and Dibang rivers. one of them of earth, and the other of brick on both sides, built forty yards wide. Its doors are made of brick. This fort is called Shishupal Fort. Colonel SF Hannay visited the plateau between the Dikrang and Dibang rivers in Sadia in 1848 and described the fort of Bhishma and the city of Prithini. According to him, Bhishma&amp;#39;s fort extended about four miles north of Sadia to the Dibang River and used bricks and stones and had paved doors and holes for shooting arrows and sticks. Prithimi Nagar is situated on the banks of the Dikrang River to the east of Sadia. This city is several miles northwest and north There is an 18-foot-high wall of land. There are several ponds inside the fort, a stone pier in the pond, a brick gate in the middle of the forest and an opening leading to the river. It is not known who used bricks and stones in these. In addition to these (Harmati on the north bank on the banks of Dikrang river in Laluk mouzas of North Lakhimpur sub-division), Mayapuri (Dafal, two days&amp;#39; journey from Harshati. On the banks of Rapani, a tributary of Dikrang river in the mountains). There are towns and signs of the use of bricks in them at Naxa Hill, (the cattle of Bihali Mouza in Tezpur sub-division, six miles north of Bagicha) and Bhalukpung (at the foot of the Akan hills west of the Bharali river in Tezpur sub-division). Bhalukpung is said to have been built by Bhalura, the grandson of the famous Ban king. Harmati is said to have been the mother of King Arimatta. (Many of the ruins on the north bank are said to belong to King Arimattha). The late Dihingia king [S Hummung] married two daughters named Harmati and Darmati, Khanbibi of Gaurja. The city may also be named Harrari after the name of this princess Harmati. Raj Rukmini, the daughter of Bhishma, was wanted by her uncle Rukma to marry Shishupala but at that time Krishna of Dwarka abducted Rukmini. If this mythical king Bhishma belongs to Sadia, then the Bhishma Fort and Shishupal Fort date back to mythical times</content>

<content>Make a short state. According to the sages, the mythical Bhishma was the king of Berar. These ruins indicate that Dafal once flowed from the Misimi Mountains on the north bank The mountains and the south of them were ruled by one or more civilized nations up to the end of the mountains (from Brahmkund and Parashuram Kund to the Ak. mountains). According to Colonel Henney, the Brahmaputra once flowed along the mountains and eventually the towns along the mountains were abandoned as it moved south. The itabils found in these cities may date back to the Kacharis. According to Sir EA Gait, the Kacharis were the first to introduce bricks in Dimapur. We cannot support this. There are many ways to get a job in the country Pov It is not permissible. No monument of the Kacharis has been discovered there to this day No, it&amp;#39;s not. We are part of Da Ati village in Bhairavpad Mouza of Tezpur sub-division 7′ × 5kt × 1 cubic inch to 1 × 102 × 1nk loan inch in temple, Barsal. The district&amp;#39;s own barsal. Bricks are available from 72′ ×4 × Dhan inches in the village and 32′ × 34 × 2 cubic inches to 9′′ ×5′′ × 1E cubic inches in Bhangamandir village (1943-46 AD). These ruins date from the 8th to the 11th centuries. According to Sir EA Gait, the Kacharis were the fourth Raj of the Dimapur dynasty. Chakravarti first built a brick city in Dimapur. He believes that this king was after the thirteenth century. Therefore, it must be said that bricks were introduced in Assam by a Hindu king before the Kacharis. in the Kalika Purana If the legend about the origin of Brahmkund and Parashuram Kund is true, then it is It is believed to be in the mountains of the northeastern part of Assam In an era not covered by history, the Aryan sage Shantanu and his wife Amogha lived there and Parashurama, the sixth incarnation of Hinduism, came there. Therefore, the Aryan settlements and civilization spread to the northeastern part of Assam in the prehistoric period. Parashurama visited the earth eleven times and made the earth a star. It is possible that Parashurama also established the Kshatriya kingdom of Assam</content>

North Lakhimpur was once ruled by the Bhuiyans. They were Shaktas. It is possible that they built these temples. The Bhuiyans and Chutia ruled at the same time. This is where the question arises Where was the boundary between the states? This boundary seems to be between Lakhimpur town and Dhemaji Mouza. Therefore, for the sake of argument, it can be said that Dhagua, Nil Gosani, Bathavati Gosani, Panchanan (Guhya Kalika), Garkhiya Than, etc. are short The kings do it. When the Chutia became Hindus is nowhere to be found. Even today, their once priestly Deuris have a separate religion. That’s the religion of the Chutia It was religion. Therefore, it is hard to believe that they built some temples only in the western part of the state without building temples elsewhere in their kingdom. The Chutia claim to be descendants of the Hindu god Kubera, just as they claim to be descendants of the mythical king Bhishma. These claims are not based on history—they are based on mythology. Mythological legends cannot be called Ruranji. It is said that the city of Tishmaka was located at Kungil (Kungin) where the fortress of Bhishma was discovered. There is still the Kungil River in the area. Bhishma&amp;#39;s son Rukma decided to give his daughter Rukmini to Shishupal. Shishupal Fort is located some distance from Bhishmak Nagar. These things seek to prove the truth of mythology. Shishupal Fort, Bhishma Fort etc. Who and when It is not known if it is given. Some may try to prove the mythology to be true. The group report of Lakhimpur district in 1929-35 mentions that this daul was built by an Ahom queen. This is not in any published history. Therefore, it is subject to proof. Lee:</content>

<content>Short states can be named. These forts may have been built by the Kacharis who ruled there before the Chutia. Many people want to prove that the Misimi are descendants of Bhishma. Some scholars believe that the city of King Bhishma was in Berar. The fence is not well known. Scholars have not yet determined which of these two views is true. For these reasons, it is impossible to say exactly that the city of the legendary king Bhishma was located at Kungil in Sadia. Sri Gopinath Shaikia BA has discussed this extensively in his book “Indumati”. He has a lot to say based on assumptions and evidentiary. Therefore, after reading his books, we cannot say that his opinion is completely accurate. Deodhai is the ancestor of the Chutia of the dynasty of King Bhirrok (Bhishma). wife of Birpal Kubera has intercourse with Rupavati and made their son Gaurinarayana king of Chutia. This history seems to combine the prevailing legend; for who wrote of the Chutia of that time There is no history. The Bhuiyans on the western border of the Chutia kingdom were Shaktas. Brahmkunda was the ashram of the Aryan sage (if Kalik. The legend of the origin of the Brahmaputra in the Puranas is believed to be true). There were Bamuns in the Habung section of the Chutia kingdom during the reign of His Majesty Tyaokhamthi (1378 or 80-89 AD). For these reasons, it must be said that it is short The kingdom was inhabited by Hindus. Now the question arises, Chutiya Raj. Whether he was a Hindu or a non-Hindu. Short The names of the kings indicate that they were Hindus. Their priests, the Deuris, were non-Hindu and they still worship “Girichagiri” (old men), “Pichadema” (PISHADEMA eldest son or Bali. Baba) and “Peshasi” (PESHASI ji or Tamar&amp;#39;s mother or Kechaikhati). does. For this reason, it must be said that the Chutia kings were originally non-Hindu There are many benefits to be gained by making the king Hindu. For this reason, Hindus are short Bhishma Raja on the origin of kings. and may include the god of Kure. Both of these factors suggest that the Chutia kings became Hindus under the influence of Hinduism; But he is</content>

<content>The Chutia kingdoms gave their priestly Deuris complete freedom to describe themselves. of the Ahom kings This happened. The Ahom kings accepted the Burma of the Deuris and gave them complete freedom in their class affairs. The British did not touch religion. Currently, our country is a secular country. For these reasons, the Deuris still practice their own religion. 2 The Yogini Tantra tells us that the Saurarans ruled in the east of Karrupa, the Kuras in the west, the Plabakas in the north and the Varanas in the south. In 1497, Hussain Shah of Gaur destroyed the kingdom of Komtapur and in 1515, Vishwa Singh, son of Mech Haria Mandal of Chiknagram in Khutaghat pargana, established the Koch kingdom. The Yogini Tanna does not mention the kingdom of Komtapur, while it says that there were wars between the Kuras, Saumars and Yavanas. Biswa Singh ruled from 1515 to 1540 on the north bank of the Brahmaputra from the Barandi to the Kabtawa river, ie in Kamrup, Goalpara and parts of Bengal north of the Brahmaputra. At that time, a part of Saumar was ruled by the Ahom king Swargadeo Chuhungmu or Swarganarayana (1497–1539 AD). Souma Peeth is the eastern part of ancient Kamrup. At that time, many countries except the Koch kingdom, including parts of southern Kamrup, were under the Islamic Pathan kings. the Muslims The peoples from the west of India were called Yavanas as Yavanas. There was a war between the Kochs, Ahoms and Muslims in the kingdom of Kamrup at that time. In the Yogini Jnajnya, what happened in Kamarupa after the war between these three castes is not known. These facts suggest that Brahmin scholars wrote the Yogini Tantra in the Koch kingdom during his reign in order to convert the Koch king Vishwasangha to Hinduism. In the Yogini Tantra, King Binu Singh (Bishu alias Vishwa Singh) of Kurach (Koch) was born to Revati (Hira) daughter of Glace (Mace) near Yoni Gavar (Yoni Peeth of Famakhya) in Koch country (Kochakhya). The Yogini Tantra refers to the king of Saumara as Kankati, the widow of the wicked king Dhritarashtra (one of the wives of Dhritarashtra in the Mahabharata).</content>

<content>50 Jai and she is Gandhari) in the womb of the heavenly king Indra (the Ahom history does not mention Kankati and Aripam). The Yogini Tantra says that Plarkabila ruled in the northern part of Kamrup at that time. Historically, the Bhuiyans and their predecessors ruled the Chutia kingdom to the north of the Brahmaputra and to the north of the Ahom kingdom. The Yogini Tanva does not mention the kingdoms of the Jaru Kacharis of the Bhuiyans on the north and south banks. The word “Pal” is found after the names of the Chutia kings. For these reasons, it can be assumed that the “Plobaks” mentioned in the Yogini Tantra are the Chutia. The following legend is found in the Yogini Tantra about Plobaka. The Bahulikas, sons of Shalva, were killed in the Kurukshetra battle and their widow named Kihi went to Vishweshwar in Kashi in the hope of having a son. His gatekeeper Mahakala Bhairava had intercourse with him. Their son Mahankush took the name of Plab and went to Mani Mandap (the location of Mani Mandap is unknown) and became king. These legends of the Yogini Tantra seem to have been written for purposes based on legends, half-truths and fiction. “Short.” Shabdte Where else How, when The origin is unknown. The Ahom called them “Tiura”. The Chutia are divided into five categories, namely: (1) Hindu Chutia, (2) Deuri Chutia, (3) Barahi Chutia, (4) Ahom Chutia and (5) Miri Chutia. “Short.” The word “Hindu” before the word means that the Chutiyas were non-Hindu in the past and later converted to Hinduism from other Chutiyas By adding the word “Hindu” before the word “Chutiya” to distinguish himself, he calls himself “Hindu Chutiya.” introduces himself as Today in Assam, “short.” They are called “Hindu Chu Tia.” because “Deuri Chutiya” is called “Deuri”. Yes and other shorts Cannot be found. Therefore, no one mentions the word “Hindu” before “Hindu Chutia”. The Hindu Chutia are a purely Hindu and Assamese community, belonging to other back ward classes.</content>

When all the impossible castes converted to Hinduism, they were placed at the lower level of the prevailing Shutra caste and were placed in the ranks of the Buj caste of the time. In the early sixteenth century, when their kingdom was lost, they could not exercise their rights and others did not count on them. However, today the customs of the nation have disappeared and will soon disappear. They are almost all great men They are similar to the Assamese Hindu community in all respects. The Deuris were the priests of the Chatias. They are known as Deuris, although they are Chutia. They currently have no relationship with other Chutia. They are among the top tribes of the plains. Inland and forested in Lakhimpur, Darang and Sibsagar districts and they dwelt in their stead. They are the hill tribes of Assam and the Assamese who come down from the mountains and live in the plains of Assam They also live in changhars by allowing the tribes to live in changhars. The villagers feed in rows or groups. The houses are long and wooden poles to build bamboo sheds, bamboo walls Give it a straw. There is a path through the mouth of the khar and a wooden ladder to climb to the shed. The Deuri villages and houses look like the villages and houses of Misikal. There are many ways to get away from these things, but the most important thing is to get away from these things. The Deuris belong to monogamous families. In the 1940 census, we found up to 100 or 60 people in some devout Deuri families. The fact that so many people live in the same house gives an idea of how long and spacious their houses can be. They are strong, healthy, hardworking and very good farmers. Their women do all the work of the plough. They know how to cut and weave houses and fields except yarn war. ●</content>

<content>The Deuris of the Chutia kingdom are similar to the Assamese for their dress and ornaments. Their clothes are very clean. They raise chickens and pigs and make a wine at home and they go. They cannot do much bamboo cultivation in the villages because of pig farming and the villages are dirty. To grow bamboo in the village, you have to build a large fence to prevent pigs from entering. There is no child marriage among them, but polygamy, widow marriage and abduction are common. Their festivals are Bahag Bis, Magh Bihu and “Nangatar Puja.” Deodhani rises on Bahag Bihu and celebrates Bihu at night from Fagun to Bahag They lived near the river Tengpani and called their tribes “Tik.” (2) Bar Ganya (lived near the Barpani river.)

<content>Chutia Rajya Temple is very old. According to Hindus, the temple is a temple of Lord Mahadev and according to Colonel Harry, it is a Buddhist temple. It is difficult to say which of these two views is true, because The Deuris who worship it are neither Hindus nor Nahars (now some Hindus. ) nor Buddhists. Colonel Henry says it is hexagonal in a wide space between a temple made of stone on the outside and brick on the inside There is an altar. They worship on the rocky heights in front of it. The eldest son is Ra Bali Baba is called “PISHADEMA”. Baliyo Baba&amp;#39;s temple It was in the area where the Giricha-giri temple was located. They worship the “Pichadema” in the Tengpania game. The daughter or mother of Tamar or Kechai Khati is called “PESHASI”. The Kechaikhati or Tamreshwari Temple is mentioned above. In the villages, they build temples of Tamar Mai, 8 feet long and 8 feet wide, made of wood and straw in the shape of the Tareshwari temple in Sadia. In Majuli, such temples have copper roofs. The Ahom kings treated the priests of the Tamreshwari temple equally. These pujas are celebrated in the months of Magh Rih, Bahag Bihu and Shaon. There are many ways to get away from these things. There are many ways to get away from these things. There are many ways to get away from these things, but the most important thing is to get away from these things breaks down. There is no atonement without Chari Deuri. They fill a copper bucket with water at the place where the five gods are worshipped, place it in the middle, bathe and feed the person who is to be worshiped at the end of the worship. The people take the punishment of the guilty and the priest receives only one rupee. Each temple has four workers named Bardeuri, Saru Deuri, Bar Bharali and Saru Bharali. The priests are called Bar Deuri and Saru Deuri. The storehouses cannot enter the temple; They are only keepers of the temple treasures.

<content>Srilankeshwar Gohain, a descendant of Sarbananda Singh, informs us that according to history, Sarbananda Singh is not a Maran but a Buk (Borok) Chutia. This is written “Matak Rajya”. There is a game called Buruk among the Ahom. There are 32 generations of Ahom history that Thakumtha was called “Lukhurakhun”. Luthubakhun is a game of the Ahom. Ahom chutiy :—Chaolud Sukaf There is a mixture of Ahom and Chutia since their arrival in Assam. This combination may not be over. Chaolud Sukapha hired a short man to work for Chomdeo and made him Chomdhibing. He had eight sons: Khatmu, Khamu, Tefaimu, Lungchi, Langthaki, Nadi U and Saimu Nane. Naziu&amp;#39;s sister had a quarrel with him and the other seven brothers tried to kill him It continued to happen. Therefore, his name became “Pit Han” meaning Hah Bandhira (“Pit” means “swan” and “Han” means “keeper” in Tai Ahom language). and later his dynasty became the Lahan Khel of the Ahoms. •Njio&amp;#39;s seven brothers Khatwal Chetia “ta hal.

Tan Khambar Gohain gave his daughter Nancha Gavruk to Swargadeo Khor When she married the king (1552-1603 AD), Lachimu gave Chutia as dowry. The king named Langi Bhangari Gohai Bhangari Chetia. His brother Lathipak remained the horseman of the Bar Gohai. (Pu: O: Bu: 38 p.). In the battle with Turba Kar (1532–33 AD) during the reign of Swargadeo Chuhumung, a very beautiful man was captured. The king named him “NUKTUR DANG”. His Majesty Sukham Phai (1552–1603 AD) appointed these Dhar men as Katidat Duwaras. (A: Bu: 37-p. ). His Majesty Hussein (1603–41 AD) appointed the grandson of Katidat Duwara as Tamuli Duwari and later as Tamuli. He appointed his son Hilai Dari Barua and settled him in Kaliabar. This is found in the Purani Assam Buranjib, p. 31: In the days of His Majesty Suhan Far (1488-93 AD), see Banduk Bob Gohain, who occupied the village of Chutia and liked the work of a Chutia brought from there.

<content>Chutia Kingdom During the Ahom kingdom, as mentioned above, many Chutia were made Ahom and included in one of the games of the Ahom. Those cannot be selected now. They are now Shirfuta Ahom. This success led to the establishment of a marriage relationship between the Rahire O Ahom and the Chutia and a special game called Ahomchutiya. They are called Ahom-Chutia because the Ahom did not give them society because they mixed with San and the Chutia did not give them society became known by the name. presently Ahomchutia I don&amp;#39;t think so. They are either Ahom or Chutia. Very short They are still Ahom by identifying themselves as Ahom. This is probably After sucking Those who are Ahom will deny it; But we have seen one of the same family as Chutia and the other as Ahom. In the Tai Ahom language, Chutia is called “Tiura”. Miri is short. : — Both Miri and Chutia originally lived close together in the mountains. The Chutia expanded their kingdom in the plains and came down to the plains. The Miris also descended to the plains to escape the invasion of the Abar and settled in the Ahom kingdom under the orders of the Ahom king. The people who were mixed between the Chutia and the Miris were called the “Mirichutia” or “Chutia”. The Ahom kings invaded the kingdom of Chutia and some of the Chutia fled and settled among the Miris and married them “Going to the caste” is called. The Chutiyas deny this and say that only those who lost the battle with the Chutiyas and stayed in the Chutiyas&amp;#39; houses are Chutiyas Miri is called. According to Ahom history, the Ahom kings were short When he conquered the kingdom (1523 AD), some of the Miris accepted the submission of the Ahom kings and undertook to pay tribute to them</content>

<content>He established the kingdom of Chutia. It is believed that these Miris came to the collection of Chutia and became known as “Chutia Miri”. They settled on the borders of the Chutia kingdom and it was natural to mix between the Miri and Chutia on the border. This natural assembly may result in a shorter Niri answer. In short, those who originated from the combination of Chutia and Miri for whatever reason were the first of the Chutia Miri or Miri Chutia Miri to settle in the plains of Chamguria Miri. Those who are now known as Chutia have nothing to do with Chutia Niri Chutiya Raja:-Sibsagar District gazettecr&amp;quot; edited by Mr. BC Allen, cs. L. Deve (later received his Doctorate degree ) edited According to the Deodhai Assam Buranji, Chutiyasbalas was the first red Birpal or Bibar. In the beginning, the Chutia lived in the mountains on the banks of the river Sovanshiri in the Abar and Nirib regions. According to the Deodhai Asan History, Birpal became king of 60 houses in front of Sonagiri Mountain in 1111 AD and took the name Gayapal. His wife The union of Kubera with Rupavati is mentioned above. The Sibsagar District gazetteer states that Bibar and his son are forest dwellers He conquered the tribes and extended his kingdom to the Brahmaputra and defeated King Bhadrasena before 1204 AD. According to Sir Gait Sahib&amp;#39;s history, Sonagiripal or Gaurinarayan, son of Birpal, had cities at Rangalgiri, Nilgiri and Chandragiri and he defeated King Bhadrasena in battle and built a city at Ratnapur and took the name of Ratnadhvaja Pala. Deodhai Assam History says that Gaurinarayan lived in Kalgiri, Nilgiri, Dhabalgiri, and Chandragiri After subduing Chutia, conquering the kingdom of King Bhadrasena of the Swetgiri Mountains,</content>

<content>? The Chutia kingdom found many weavers, goldsmiths, craftsmen, tailors, blacksmiths, etc., and made Bhadrasena&amp;#39;s son his king and built a city at Ratnapur. This Ratnapur or Raktan Pur was in North Lakhimputra or Majuli according to the Sibsagar District Gazetteer *. It is said above that Majuli did not exist before 1750 AD. We call North Lakhimpur the North Bank; But at present Majuli is called the North Bank despite being on the north bank of the Brahmaputra It doesn&amp;#39;t go. This is also supported by the fact that there was no Majuli in Assam in the past. In the tenth issue of Awahan in the eighth year, Mr. Bhram Chandra Shaikia wrote in his article entitled “The Kingdom and Cities of Chutia King Satyanabayana” that the eastern part of Majuli and the southern part of Hari region were Habung and Sadaypur. Although it is a famous place on which he wrote this, the exact location is unknown. According to Dr. Wade Chahar, Habung is 30 × 15 square miles and is located at the confluence of the Champara and Sovansiri rivers. Dr. Wedb The miles are approximate. When I read the description he wrote, it seems that the miles he gave are wrong. Chaolundu Hukapha (1228–68 AD) established his capital at Habung. He left the place because it was deep and flooded. What happened to his daughter-in-law during the reign of His Majesty Chaopha Taoswamathi is written above. In 1562, Swargadeo Sudhampha alias Khawa Raja sent the people of Habung to fight against Chilarai. Therefore, this Habung is on the north bank of the Luit, north of the confluence of the present Sovansiri and Luit This section is still a deep place. In short, it is not known exactly where Ratnapur was in southern Assam, but it must have been on the north bank of the Sovansiri and Dihingnai, which once flowed into the Luit. We say that the story of the Gaon*Gazetteer is written from the writings of the Ahoms. Lih</content>

Ubram Chandra Shaikia in the above article writes that the Chutia were the original Raj He was succeeded by his brother Bhadrasena, who had no son, but was probably defeated by his nephew Birpal. Therefore, his words are proven. Hence we Bibbab or Birpalbe the first Raj of the Chutia must be assumed presently. History tells us that Bhadrasen Bab was defeated by Yirpal.

There are many ways to get a job in the UK might. The Barnadi is on the north bank of the Pur boundary of Kamrup district and the Ranganai is four miles west of North Lakshinpur town. Therefore, it is seen that the Chutia kingdom first crossed the border of Assam or the Barnadi and later retreated to northern Lakhimpur. History says that the Chutia kingdom was on the north bank of the Brahmaputra, the Barbhuiya kingdom was on the west and the Komtapur kingdom was on their west and the Gaur kingdom was reached only after crossing the Komtapur. Gaur and Chutiya There is no mention of the kingdoms of Komtapur and Barbhuiyas in the wars between the kingdoms. etc. For these reasons, the words of Shaikia are proven. Sonagiripal alias Gauri Narayan alias Ratnabaj Pal stay by his kingdom Who He defeated a king named Nyayapal and married his daughter. He then invaded the kingdom of Kamatapur and forced Kamateshwar to give him his daughter in marriage. When he went to invade the kingdom of Gaur, the king of Gaur made friends with him and undertook to send him Ganges water seven times a day, in exchange for which Gaudeshwar asked for water from the Parashuram Kund. Ratnarajapala killed one of his sons in Gaur for the sake of Vidya Arjuna; but he died there. Gaudeshwar sent the body to Ratnabaj Pala. When Ratnabaja went on a pilgrimage to the Indus Valley, his son&amp;#39;s body reached the place. Therefore he called the name of that place Yahweh. In time, the name of the place became Sadia.

Ratnadhvajapala or Gauri Narayana or Sonagiripala is a Hindu name. These names and the exchange of waters of the Ganges and Parashuram Kund suggest that he was a Hindu. It is not known whether he converted to Hinduism. There were fortune tellers and Brahmins in the kingdom of Bhadrasena. That’s why it happens Hindu subjects can also give him Hindu names.

The seventh is short They have nothing to say except the relationship between the Chutia kings and the Ahom from the king to the last. There are many examples of these characters in the Ahom history They are said to have conquered the kingdom. The following is what happened between the Ahom and Chutia kings. Mogong Obfe Mukong&amp;#39;s Raj Chalufai captured the kingdom of Chutia and became a ruler there. They leave it behind. The Chutians killed him six months later. Then the king of Mukong, Sukhanpha (Chamlupha and Sukhanpha were priests.) sent Suk|pha to conquer the kingdom of Chutia. He captured the kingdom of Chutia and left. This incident 1228 BC.

When they agreed to pay the tribute, he let them live as they were. The king appointed one from Komtapur, one from Chutia (Maran) and one from Naga to collect taxes! A Kachari is from these states They left a guard to collect taxes. These kings paid gifts and taxes when Swargadeo came to this country (Assam). His Majesty Chaolud Tao Tufai (1364-76 AD) invaded the Chutia kingdom during the reign of Sambhar Chutia king Golok Narayan. He made a treaty with the king of Chutia, and made an alliance with him.

The river Routa and Dhansiri are two rivers in Mangaldai sub-division The Dhansiri is about sixteen miles north of the town and the Dhansiri is about six miles away There are many different types of railways in the country There are many different types of roads in the area.

<content>The Chutia kingdom was established in the Chatia region of Tezpur sub-division and the word “Chatia” is derived from the word “Chutia”. In our opinion, Gohain Barua&amp;#39;s statement is wrong for the above reasons. For this reason the word “chutia” is derived from “chatiya.” That cannot be believed. Sir EA Galt&amp;#39;s history is short He moved the dynasty to Pakriguri. Now Therefore, it is important to understand the importance of the Ahom society in the area. Therefore, it is important to understand the importance of the Ahom society in the area. 1497 AD Hassan Chahe Kamat The kingdom of Pur was destroyed by the Koch Ranj in 1515 AD Biswa Singh had the opportunity to establish the Koch kingdom there. It is said that the Barnadi was the head of the kingdom of Komtapur. Therefore, wash and Chatiy The Komata kingdom was to the east and Chutia to the west and Chutia and less There were Bhuiyans in the middle of the eastern kingdom. There were wars, treaties and exchanges between the kingdoms of Chutia and Komtapur. Similarly, between the Ahom and the Komtapur There was an exchange and His Majesty Chaolundu Tao Sukhafai (1293–1332 AD) married Bajeni, princess of Komata, and His Majesty Chaoshda Fai (13971407 AD) married Nafajeni, princess of Komata For these reasons, it can be said that the whole is short and between the Ahom kingdom and the Komtapur kingdom to the west, there was no very powerful kingdom on the banks of the Buhmaputra. The Bhuyans of the northern bank joined the Ahom Empire. Therefore, the king established the Chutia prince in the Routa region of the newly acquired kingdom. In 1547 AD, the Koch prince Chilra conquered the region and gradually extended the Koch kingdom eastwards to the borders of the Ahom Empire. Possibly then shorter The prince became subject to the Koch king and later disappeared. In 1523 AD, part of Pakriguri (Nagaon) was under the powerful Kacharis and part under the Bhuiyanris as small kingdoms. Therefore, the establishment of the Chutia Prince at Pakrigur by Sir EA Gait cannot be supported. 38</content>

Laklingmao Shakat Tyaoshunglung—Klinglung was named Thao Mulung-Bangan, and the boundary was made before the Luit from the king of Kangkham.” This shows that Chaoche Lung Kling Kham (Tyao Chung Kid Lung) was appointed ruler of a part of the Chutiya kingdom in 1529 AD, but the rebellion was suppressed. When the Chutia rebelled again against Thaomu Lung Frasemud and Thaomung (Tyao Chunglung-Kinglup), the king sent King Suklanpha Tipam to help Bar Gohai, who fought against the Chutia at Chandan Giri and Thaomud Bangen to Sadia Klanpha went to Kangkham with His Majesty Tyao Chengung Kangcheng and other nobles.

After the defeat of the Chutia kingdoms, Swargade sent King Charing to the Thaukang Mountains and Ragohai to fight at Chandangiri through Dikhari (at the crossroads of Dibrugarh and Sibsagar sub-divisions). The Ahom, unable to win the battle at Chandangiri, sent Khaomud Klingkham to capture some of the Chuchia men, young and old, south of Chalangiri and join Swargadeo. The king went from Sadia to Kangkham and from there to Difalumukh. When King Charing Deo returned from his house, the Chutia surrounded him by the Luit. Thaoshu Rangen, Tyaochengu and Katyehanan came by boat in Dibang, rescued the king of Charing, defeated the Chutia, captured some of them and handed them over to Swargadeo at Kankham. The king left the army of Bargohai and Khaoshungen at Sadia and returned to the capital. (De: O: Ru: 23-24 pp.). The account of the rebellion shows that it was widespread and fresh. The names of those who led the rebellion are not available. Sir EA Gait&amp;#39;s history tells us that Suchirarila rebelled in 1542 AD during the reign of His Majesty Suklenmung. The Ahom chronicles say that in 1542-43 AD, the Chutiarilas killed Hanan at Dichang but Chaolungtima destroyed the Chutia kingdom. Therefore, it is important to note that the present study is not only a study of the characteristics of these characters, but also of the characteristics of the characters in the film handed over 53. .” Sir EA Gait&amp;#39;s history tells us that the Chutiarila revolted in Tipas and Namrup in 1563 AD and in 1572 AD during the reign of His Majesty Sukhampha. Every rebellion was suppressed by the Ahoms. These are the words given below on pp. 46 and 47 of the Deokhai Assam Buranji</content>

In Assam, clan was once given higher status and respect than knowledge, intelligence, wealth, power, etc. and this practice is still going on in the innermost parts of the country. Therefore, even if the children of the Bhuyans did not have knowledge, intelligence, wealth, power, etc., they were respected in the society. This proverb does not indicate that the Bhuiyans were once of a prestigious elite family. Those who ruled the kingdom by their own arms without being played were called Bhuyans. There are two main types of Bhuiyans in Assam. The Eridh Bhuyan originates in North Lakhimpur and the other type originates in the state of Komtapur. For convenience of writing, the Bhuyans of Lakhimpur are called the Bhuyans of the Southern Khand and the Bhuyans of Komtapur are called the Bhuyans of the Southern Khand. These two types of Bhuiyans have different ancestors. The Bhuyans of the Southern Khand were not a separate kingdom and the Bhuyans of the Southern Khand were not a separate kingdom. The southern section was not ruled by one Bhuyan and the southern section by another. Both south and south There were many Bhuiyans in the sector at the same time. Each Bhuiyan had a small kingdom. Nothing is known exactly which Bhaiya ruled in which section. The Bhuiyans of the southern section ruled contemporaneously with the Chutia on the north bank of the Brahmaputra from the west of the Chutia kingdom to the Pur border of the Komatapur kingdom, ie west of the Sovanshiri river</content>

Some believe that the kingdom of the Bhuiyans of the southern part of the north bank extended only to Bishwanath in the west. The Bhaya kingdom was divided into smaller kingdoms named Lakhimpur, Bihupur, Narayanpur, Ralpur, Gahpur, Kalangpur, Bishwanath, etc. The Bhuiyans of the southern part were under the rule of the king of Komtapur in an area of Nagaon and west of the Barnadi.

Sambhar this fort was killed by the glorious king. Some say that the wife of King Ramachandra was abducted by the Brahmaputra and that their son was King Arimattha. Some say that it is the Raj of Ratnapur. The son of Mayurdhvaja was Tamradhvaja, his son Pratapuria and his wife Harmati (daughter of Harvinda, descendant of Iravatta, king of Saumar).

This king was named Arimattha because his death resembled that of Arimas. The following story is found in the “Assam Buranji” found in the house of Mr. Sukumar Mahant: – Swargadeo Sahumud alias Dihingia The king (1497-1539 AD) placed Kamateswar in the hands of Sankham Ghar Sandikey, son of Frasenmud Bargohai. Then Ghar Sandikey went to Gaur country and told Gaudeshwar that Swargadeo had sent him to seek his favor. &amp;quot;This is the story. Gaudeshwar, hearing this, said to the two vessels and ministers in doubt, &amp;#39;Indra has come to enjoy the earth, what is the difference between him and us? We will meet in that kingdom.

The Harmati Fort in Dhanpur Mouza appears to date back to the Ahom period. The Satsari Assam Baranji calls Gaudeshwar “Pasa” and he gave his only daughter to Swargadeo&amp;#39;s son Gargana Raja (who was not king then) and gave him as dowry the five areas of Serpur, Patilajah, Ekhar Sindur, Kampur and Dhekera. (69-70 AD). It is possible that Gaudeshwar was a Muslim and therefore Swargade kept his daughter Harmarti as a separate city on the north bank.</content>

It is said that the pond was named “Dipra” because two ponds were dug in one afternoon.

According to the “Shankara Charit”, the following is written about Mahapurusha Srimanta Sankaradeva: In 1450 AD, when Srimanta Sankaradeva was 13 months old, the Kacharis plundered the kingdom of the Bhuyans for three days; But the Bhuiyans drove the Kacharis out of their kingdom. vSrimanta Sankaradeva became the Bhuyan of his village in 1466 AD at the age of 17 years. There were Bhuyans like Budhakh., Jayant, Madhav, Karnapur, Chaturbhuj etc. in Nagaon at that time. Then Shakti religion was predominant. He was tried in the royal court of Burhakha when the Brahmins filed a case against him for introducing the Vaishnava religion. The Brahmins were defeated in the argument. It was through the Brahmins that Srimanta Sankaradeva acknowledged the importance of devotion to Hari. After twelve years of pilgrimage, Srimanta Sankaradeva became the Bhuyan of his place again. He was 40 years old when he was on the pilgrimage. He became a Bhuyan for the second time after a few years in 1489 AD.

<content>Bhuiyan Rajya 08 Lore Dari accepted. He was the first to teach Assam to practice religion through the mother tongue instead of Sanskrit. In this regard, he is compared to his contemporary (before the turn of the century) Martin Luther of Germany can be done. He spread the Ruktavali in Assamese from the Patkai Mountains to the Karatwa River through religious books, plays, songs, etc.; That Chou established a universal - Mia language in the various kingdoms of ancient Kamrup at that time. About four hundred years before the great man Mahatma Gandhi, he tried to give equal rights to all in the world of religion and to abolish untouchability did Assam will always be indebted to Mahapurusha Srimanta Sankardeva Danava among the Bhuiyans. 6 The gifts given by Srimanta Sankara Deva to Assam facilitated its establishment and helped it to the utmost. If the Swargadevas had not given facilities and help vSrimanta Sankaradeva left Assam and went to the Koch kingdom, his gifts would have withered and dried up. There are many Vaishnava satras in Assam, including the four satras, established by the Swargade and many satras by the nobles and officials. There is no satra, religious place, temple or shrine in Assam that the Swargadevas did not patronize and did not give Nishkar land and pike to work there. The land donated by the heavenly gods is still enjoyed by satras, religious places, temples, etc. as nipikheraj (half rent) and lakhebaj (no rent). It is with the grace of the Swargadevas that all branches of Hinduism flourished in Assam and are still alive today. It is very sad that many people do not want to admit this, instead, they blame the heavenly gods. It is said, “Where vegetables, sandalwood ; Even if it’s a particle, it’s a juggernaut.”</content>

The Kacharis left the Dhansiri Valley and Diapur and moved to Kachar. Since then, the Dhansiri Valley and the Dimapur area have remained forests to this day. The forest reserve of its present name is located in the Dhansiri Valley. Swargade established the Kachari prince Madan at Lakshidrapur in 1540 AD under the name of Nirbhara Narayan (Durllat Narayan according to Dr. JP Wade). Therefore, the Kachari kings were called the Swapitsanchit of the Ahom kings. The Kacharis established their kingdom in Kachar and their capital in Mayabanga. The Ahoms conquered the Kachari kingdom and the western border of the Ahom Empire reached the Bhuyan kingdom of Nagaon. The Bhuiyans of Nagaon were conquered by the Ahoms during the reign of Chaophasuclen Mud alias Garhwal (1539–52 AD). In the future, the Bhuiyans rebelled and were transferred to the Ahom capital.

Therefore, it is important to understand the importance of these words. (“Strong Protest”—1st BC —Sri Sri Utsavananda Adhikar Goswami, Mayamara Purani Mati Satra. ) The same Mayam be descended from the same lineage of the sect The same word “matek” or “matak” of the satradhikars of “Purani Mati” satra and “Napam” or “Dinjay” satra did not mean the same thing. &amp;quot;&amp;quot; * Matak :— During the reign of Chaopha Sahinngam Mung alias Swargadeo Gaurinath Singh (1780–94 AD) the Mayamarias revolted and spread.

<content>They were made to work in the Matak kingdom. At that time the southern region of Sadia was under the &amp;quot;Bor Senapati&amp;quot; from the Buputra, Dibru and Dangri rivers to the Dihing river. The Tsingfao could not capture or loot much from this area but took advantage of the anarchy to capture the people of the surrounding plains. Therefore, the Tsingfao called the people of Bob Senapati&amp;#39;s area “Matak” meaning “Bali” and the people of his Pur area “Mulung” meaning “Durbani”. ( Imperial Gazetteer of India. Eastern Bengal and Assam.) It seems that the Mayamaris of the Bar Senapati area began to use the term “Matak” used by the Singphourilas to describe themselves as victims They are known as “Mataks”. As such, “Matak” does not belong to any caste or religious community; But they are residents of a particular area. They are the Maramarias in the present religion and most of them are from Assam There are people in the community. The main satras of Mayamaria are located in Dibrugarh sub-division except for the old land. The term “Matak” is widely used in Dibrugarh sub-division. If the word “Matak” means “sacrifice” as the Chinkes say, then the name “Matak” cannot be disgusting or condemnatory. History says that the area ruled by Barsenapati was known as Matak. Therefore, the victims of the area ruled by the Bar Senapati are the Mayamaris who can be called “Matak”.

There are many ways in which you can improve your self-confidence Srimanta Sankaradeva completely severed his ties with him for stealing the “Dhatutamarakshari Kalpataru Shastra” and has had nothing to do with the Mayamarias ever since. This view is wrong, as Bharajnikant Bardoli has argued extensively in the introduction to the Banshavali Puthi. Not all Hindus in Assam are Mahapurushas or Bhagavati Vaishnavas. This is non-great The Hindus also have no social ties with the Mayamaris. If the “Adi Charit” is true then the non-great Assamese There is no reason why Hindus should not associate with the Mayamaris by having social relations with the Mahapurushas. -- Masculine Assamese Hindus do not have social relations with Mayamarias There is a reason other than the words of the “Adi Charit”. The Mayamarias fought against the Assam monarchy several times since the days of Chaopha Suyeu alias Swargadeo Lakshi Singh (1768–1779 AD). He rebelled and deposed Swargadeo Laxni Singh and Chaopha Shahipud alias Swargadeo Gaurinath Singh (1779–1792 AD) and ruled for a while. In 1768, the rebel Mayamaria Maran captured Swargadeo Laxnisingh and captured Mayamaria They made Bayan, the son of Mahant Ashtabhuja, king; but Mannamar The Mahant gave his son Raj. Mayamari in not letting it happen The sons of Maran Nahar Khora became Ramakant Raja and Raghav Maran Barbarua. The tiger catches the non-Mayamaris and makes them Mayamari Mahant Ashtabhuja took refuge and fined four satriyas. When Swargadeo Lakshi Singh regained the throne six months later through the cunning of Maglukunvari Kujanrani, the non-Mayamarias who had been forcibly converted to Mayamarias were atoned for by Swargadeo&amp;#39;s orders and resumed their religion.

<content>$ When the Mariaris began to rule, they attacked the religion of the non-Mayamarias, destroyed temples and rigrahs, and burned villages and lands They were tortured. It is probably for these reasons that the non-Mawamarirai had nothing to do with the Mayambia. The Banshavali Pukhi records that during the reign of Swargade Cha Singh (1810–18 AD and 1819-21 AD), Charitra filed a complaint in the Raj Sabha demanding that the Maraviras be tried for treason, killing children, old men, women, Brahmins, etc. According to the case, the trial was held in the royal council for seven days, and at the end of the trial, the king suggested that atonement should be made for the murder of both the Mayamaria and non-Mayamaria during the rebellion. According to that opinion, who The parties remained divided without atonement. This is the story. Not in any history. In short, from the historical point of view Therefore, it is important to understand that the non-Mayamaris cut off all ties with them because they rebelled and converted to the religion of the non-Maramarias. Today, a non-Mawamari does not eat, marry or sit with a Mayamari of the same community and Hindu religion. There are many reasons why you should not be afraid to go to the gym.

It was in the area. 1805 AD: Sarbananda Singh of Mayamari The Ahom again rose up against Bajashakti in conjunction with Marap. He sent Ramnath Barbarua and brought Duban Nan against Assam. It is not Badan Chandra Barphukan who brought the first standard to Assam; But it is Swayantaja Sarbananda Singh. The Manasena was captured twice by the sharp vision and cunning of Rajni Purnananda Buragohain. They were defeated by the Mayamaria-Maran at Bahutia Ting and fled to Holonga Guri. They were in need of food during the rainy season. Swargade settled them in Khilamra (North Lakhimpur sub-division). There are many ways in which you can improve your self-confidence. There are many ways in which you can improve your self-confidence They established their king in the territory between the Ruhmaputra and Budhidihing rivers (most of the southern part of present-day Dibrugarh sub-division). The great general collected rent from the people of this land and promised to pay it to the king. Some say that Sarbananda Singh appointed his son Matibar as the chief commander of his army. In 1881, the British officers reported to the Government of India as &amp;quot;Sarbananda Bar Senapati&amp;quot;. Therefore, the Barsenapati appointed by Purnananda Buragohain was Sarbananda Singh Badan Chandra Barphukan brought honor to Assam against Purnananda Buragohain.

Ruchinath Brajnath&amp;#39;s son Purandarak Raja They put it together. Chandrakant Singh brought Man under Alumingi and ascended the throne again in 1819 AD. Purandara Singh and Ruchinath fled. Therefore, it is necessary to take into consideration the fact that the country&amp;#39;s economy is developing rapidly and the country&amp;#39;s economy is developing rapidly. Chandrakant Singh included Kalibar, son of the rebel Sarbananda Singh, in the Buragohain game and made him minister Rudhagohain. These Burhagohai tribes were included in the Burhagohai game as “Matak”. Therefore, it is important to note that the present study is not only a study of the characteristics of the country, but also of the characteristics of the country&amp;#39;s economy. The characteristics of the country&amp;#39;s economy are similar. Such stories reward the generosity and merit of the Ahoms towards their enemies. Kalir maintained the belief in which Swargadeo Chandrakant Singh appointed Kalibar as his minister Buragohain. Swargade got the throne with the help of the Mans but did not support the brutality of the Mans. He built a fort at Rat Dighali Ghat, where the Mans came from across Jaipur, at the hands of Patal Barbarua, to prevent them from invading Assam in the future.

Mane killed all the families who had moved to Jorhat. However, the descendants of the family he left behind in Matak are still there. Therefore, it is important to note that the Ahom Empire was invaded by the Matak Gut Sarbananda Singh. The Matak kings paid tribute to Swargadeo with ivory, velvet cloth, etc. In the British days, Mr. White was told in Rangpur and Jorhat that the Matak kings paid Rs. 10,000 per annum to Swargadeo.

However, the Barsenapati did not collect rent in money from the Pur Khand, that is, the Nagi Khand in the area occupied by Singphourila, but in ivory, spices and rice. The commander was clever, enterprising, simple, efficient and ordinary in dress but six in speech. According to Mr. Robert Bruce, the commander is always dissatisfied and whoever was ready to join any secret rebellion; But according to Captain White, he was faithful. That is, when he invaded Assam, he helped the invaders with food and labor but did not give them soldiers and kept a Man Katki at his court. His descendants say that he married a daughter to the Man king and that her descendants still exist in Buhm- country. Puppet in the hands of Yogeshwar Singh Man Senapati It was just there. The Mans became the destiny of Assam. I mean, they destroyed Assam. The British declared war on the Mans after crossing the Ahom Empire and entering the territory of the British East India Company They drove out the Mans and occupied parts of Burma. The Manchuria king had no choice, 24 February 1826 AD He signed a treaty with the British at Yandaboo, saying, “Om Vasudevaaya Namah.” They gave Assam to the British and the British accepted it with pleasure. “Thieves have broken the brass.” Who is with the heavenly gods? Did not consider the words should be consulted. It wasn’t “cooking rice by asking for a choke”.

<content>The Matak kingdom ✔ did not go to help with 300 soldiers; But the British could only send 100 troops to Erar. The commander-in-chief was not required to give anything to the British except beyond British territory He had to go up and collect wholesale taxes from the people living in his territory. A British subject for that purpose was placed in his kingdom. The Barsenapati was empowered to hear minor civil and criminal cases and political agents heard cases of theft, murder, robbery, serious injury, etc. above Rs. According to this arrangement, the work was not convenient. They were scattered to the Patkai Mountains in the east of the Matak kingdom. Taking advantage of the Man invasion, Singphourila looted the eastern part of the Matak kingdom and captured people and either sold them as slaves in Burma or kept them as their own slaves. They have no royalty There was no, but each of their separate games was under a hero or gum. There were about eighteen such villages. They are the same in agriculture, trade, etc. and condemned physical labor. Slaves were their main property and plunder was their main occupation. Captain Newville won several battles with the Tsingfao in 1825 and freed many slaves. Finally, sixteen of their villages fell to the British In May 1826, he made a treaty and Bajan Gam fled. According to that treaty, Singphourila was the king of Burma or anyone else Everyone with foreigners.

The British, on the other hand, took responsibility for their protection and their close relatives so that they would keep the treaty Some were placed on bail and their education was arranged. They were dissatisfied with the British submission but were ready to throw it away at the opportunity. They are the Ranua Gohai of Khamti and the Wackun-Khujun ( Wackun Khoonfun ) of Singphou Gotkhai rebelled against Singphou. The rebels included the Khasi rebels and Swargadeo Chandrakant Singh They were contacted. Almost all the Singphou gums were involved in the rebellion, although not shown, and Barsepapati was suspected of being involved. The Barsenapati and Sadiakhwa Gohain joined Captain Newville at Sadia in February 1830 AD. The captain, with the help of them and some Tsingfao gums, completely suppressed the Tsingfao rebels in March In 1833, Swargadeo Purandara Singh of South Assam was killed They were allowed to rule by the British. At the same time, the British employees in Rangagara were removed from their posts. Swargadeo Purandara Singh should rise from his kingdom He appealed not to remove the British employee from his post in order to raise the wholesale tax of the pikes; but the British Government granted his appeal did not and of his kingdom He did not try to stop the pike from climbing to the Matak kingdom. Since the days of Mr. Robertson, the political agent, attempts have been made to collect taxes from the Matak kingdom. He believes that the commander of the army paid Rs. 12,000 per annum to Swargadeo and therefore he gave him a chariot in Sadiya He wanted to impose the burden of the expenses of the British troops on the commander and levy a tax of Rs. 50,000 per annum from him.

<content>The Matak State? He was told to sleep. The British government rejected this proposal as money was not more valuable than the friendship of the Duwaria Nayak. Mr. Jenkins sent Mr. White to the Tok kingdom in 1838 to investigate the internal conditions of the Matak kingdom with the intention of levying taxes in the Natak kingdom. And the captain of the guard divided his kingdom into seven parts, and appointed seven sons to rule over him. According to the report submitted by Mr. White in March 1838, it is known that the Matak kingdom is fertile. and there was Nadan-Badan. Mr. White did not consider it appropriate to levy taxes during the lifetime of the commander-in-chief, and in the event of his death, he gave the British half the treasury in the seven-part kingdom enjoyed by his son When asked, he approved of letting them enjoy it. The proposal was supported by Agent Mr. Jekyll; But the British Government refused to tell the Barsenapati what would happen to his kingdom if he died. In late 1838, the Barsenapati sought the approval of the British Government to appoint his third son (some say the second son) Maju Gohain as his successor. All his sons and officers shared in his actions. The British Government approved the appointment of Maju Gohain to rule the kingdom during the lifetime of the Barsenapati. In early January 1839, the commander died and Mezb White reached Rangagara on the 20th of that month. The Barsenapati left Maju Gohain as his successor. There are many ways to get a job in the UK His son and the people supported the commander&amp;#39;s actions.

Major White declared Maju Gohain the hero of the Mataks; But to pay him ten thousand taxes annually and to keep the fallen land in his kingdom for tea cultivation and to settle the dispute between the tea farmers and the people of the Matak kingdom! He was asked to keep a British employee in his kingdom. Major White wrote to maintain the arrangement which his rep&amp;#39;ty commander had left among his seven sons ; But he was in favor of defending Maju Gohain&amp;#39;s demands, as it would be easier to get supplies and labor if Assam was invaded from Burma. Major White was lost in the Khamti rebellion and Captain Vetch was appointed political officer of South Assam. The eldest son of the Barsenapati, Bargohain, himself helped the British in the Khamti rebellion. Mr. Jenkins sent Captain Vech to ask his opinion on the Matak kingdom. He informed that a tax of Rs. 10,000 would cause discontent among the heroes of the Matak kingdom and such discontent was expressed by the refusal of Majugoha to pay labor as claimed by the officiating political agent Mr. Hanna. Mr. Vetch proposed that the pike be re-enumerated in the manner adopted by Mr. Scott and that two-thirds of the pike be paid by Majugoha either to work for the British Government or to pay taxes instead Maju Gohain agreed to accept the proposal; But he refused to agree to the census by intimidating the people with the help of the army and appealed for the census to be conducted peacefully without the help of the army.</content>
