<content>Chapter 1 The Uprising of the Tai Assam is a melting pot of different races, ethnic groups and cultures. For centuries, the fertile land of the Brahmaputra Valley has attracted the attention of foreign migrants. This is the reason why people of different races and religions come here. The country&amp;#39;s fertile soil is home to the cultural ideologies of people from other parts of the country as well as Southeast Asia and Tibet. Each ethnic group has its own contribution to the larger Assamese culture today and their diverse cultural elements have enriched the field of Assamese culture. Among the ethnic groups that migrated to Assam, the Ahom made an incomparable contribution. This is evident from the fact that the name &amp;#39;Assam&amp;#39; eventually derived from the name &amp;#39;Aham&amp;#39; When the first group of Ahom migrants crossed the Patkai in 1228 AD, no one could have imagined that this would be their settlement. Here they brought technological changes such as wetland farming, and formed complex social and political organizations. It was able to unite all its ethnic groups and tribes to form a large national entity. Along with the heroes of medieval India, the Ahoms ruled Assam for about a hundred years.</content>

<content>The name of Chaolung Chu-Kapha, the founder of the Ahom dynasty among the Ahoms, will always remain high in the history of Assam. He will always be held in high esteem not only as the founder of adventurous expeditions and military strength, but also as the statesman who established the foundations and rules of the Ahom Empire. 2 Chu-ka-fa and followers were of Tai origin. They are a part of the larger Tai core. Their descendants are still known as Tai Ahom. They are descendants of the western part of the Tai. Various groups of Tai live in the main part of the north of Southeast Asia and its surrounding areas. For thousands of years, these Tai people have settled from Assam to Yunnan Province in southern China and from Bangkok to Vietnam. Tai and Khai: Proper naming: The proper ethnic names of &amp;#39;Tai&amp;#39; or &amp;#39;Thai&amp;#39; have been analyzed in different ways by different scholars, but all these theories have limitations. However, the word &amp;#39;Thai&amp;#39; is a later word and refers to &amp;#39;free&amp;#39; or &amp;#39;free people&amp;#39; The Thais who live in Thailand (formerly Shyam) have their own distinctive characteristics and traditions. In the seventh century, a Tai prince named Phra Ruang ruled Chankal (heaven). This was the kingdom of Jimme (Chiengmai). Phra Ruang was the Kartalia king of Cambodia, then a powerful kingdom in southern Indo-China. However, Phra Ruang declared Zinme&amp;#39;s independence and refused Cambodian submission. Then, in 538 AD, the Shamiz year began. Phra Ruang as the national commander of the Thais. However, his reign did not last long. After his death, his son became king and on this occasion the King of Cambodia (Jai Burman) Kiangzhen again</content>

<content>They took over the kingdom. However, Indraditya later rescued the kingdom from Cambodia and re-established the dynasty. In this respect a view of Bishop Pale Goix is universally accepted. He believes that after Phra Ruang declared the country&amp;#39;s independence, the Shyam people living here were renamed Thai (free). It is worth mentioning that Phra Ruang has been recognized as a hero by several kings. Among them is King Ram Tham-heng of Thailand. He stamped the name of Fra Ruang on the coin. The fact that several powerful kings such as Indraditya and Ram Kham-heng followed in the footsteps of Phra Ruan and described him as a hero suggests the tendency of the Thais to free themselves from Cambodia. In that sense, the word &amp;#39;Thai&amp;#39; undoubtedly originated in the eighth century. Edward Gait&amp;#39;s A History of Assam also gives the meaning of the word Tai in this way. He believes that the word &amp;#39;Tai&amp;#39; means glorious and the Chinese used it to mean celestial or divine. Similarly, the Ahom Buranji describes the Tai as the inhabitants of heaven. Nai Likhit Huntrakul “The Historical Records of the Shamiz-Chinese Relations” believes that the title of &amp;#39;Tai&amp;#39; was given to a class of people who enjoyed considerable rights and privileges in ancient times He was the second son of the first emperor of China, Huang Tai (2697-2596 BC), and the son-in-law of the third emperor, Tuan-Yak (2513-2435 BC).

<content>8 special she created family. &amp;#39;Ch-ihau was the grandson of Chiu-hau and the sister of Tuan-yok. General Chin-hau and his successors collected customs from people who used the waterways. They collected fees from people who traveled along the Pun (or Fen - Huanghu) waterway (which flows between Chan-chi and Hu-nan). However, after the fall of the Haya dynasty (2205-1766 BC), the title &amp;#39;Tai Tai&amp;#39; disappeared. Therefore, it appears that the Tai people existed in Shan-Chi and Hu-nan in China as early as 2515 BC. In ancient China, members of royal and noble families were considered Tai. However, in later times, other nobles were given this honor even though they did not have royal status. These include Chawangtai (minister), Chi-tai (viceroy), Tang-tai (under secretary), Pu-tai (provincial governor), Git-tai (provincial teacher), Pan-tai (provincial treasurer), Tien tai (provincial commander) and Tao tai (regional governor). This shows that in ancient times the word &amp;#39;tai&amp;#39; referred to a high-ranking, powerful, respectable and independent personality. However, according to this theory, the fact that the first Emperor Huang-tai and his successors were not &amp;#39;Tai&amp;#39; only creates complications. So we will discuss this theory again. According to French scholars, the inhabitants of the ancient kingdom of Sukhotai (Sukhoday) were called Tai. The inhabitants of this region were referred to by various names such as Shyam, Chayam, Siem and Chine (Hein), but later by the name Siam</content>

<content>It was called the Tai uprising. Over time, the Shyam or Sajam people took the name &amp;#39;Thai&amp;#39; (not Tai). However, there is no reliable information about the succession of the Tai people who settled in Sukhotai. &amp;amp; George Scott believes that the former Tai have been referred to by Europeans as of Shanmul. Again, A.S. According to S. Kiane, the word &amp;#39;Shan&amp;#39; is originally a Chinese word but later came into contact with Burma and is therefore related to &amp;#39;Lao&amp;#39; He believes that the name was used politically, not on the basis of ethnicity. The term &amp;#39;Shan&amp;#39; includes all the Tai people of Burma and the term &amp;#39;Lao&amp;#39; includes all the Tai people. He also wants to say that the word Shan has a British essence and the word Lao has a French essence. Dr. Grivson, on the other hand, says that the word &amp;#39;Skhan&amp;#39; is the Burmese pronunciation of the word &amp;#39;Sham&amp;#39; In Chinese, Shan means mountain or high place. The Shans settled from the Shan State and the southern mountainous states of Yunnan to the plains of southern Burma. The Burmese used the word skhan to refer to the inhabitants of the high places. The Chinese word sham&amp;#39; is Shan in Burmese; This is because the &amp;#39;m&amp;#39; at the end of a word written in Burmese becomes &amp;#39;n&amp;#39; Therefore, the Burmese version was changed to &amp;#39;Shan&amp;#39; Both mean the same thing. But these Shans have been calling themselves &amp;#39;Tai. Prehistoric and historical scholars agree that the Tai language and culture originated in China. As early as the 20th century BC, Terion Lacopari discovered the existence of a Tai people and described their appearance. According to Terion, this janka is the union of Inan, Chpei and Anhui and this keotai is the union of another Tai group, the Ai-Lao, the Lao Angai-Lao.</content>

<content>The Tai coup, however, is not without doubt about the views of Terrain and Cochrane. They are both trying to identify Chinese people who do not belong to the Han group in southern China as &amp;#39;Tai&amp;#39;. But there is no doubt that these tribes are the people of the Tai tribe. In the late nineteenth and early twentieth centuries, several scholars suggested that the Tai originated in China. According to this view, the Chinese acquired knowledge of their language, culture, science, arts and organization from the Agro-Altaic and Bok peoples who came from West Asia in the 23rd century BC. From that point of view, the terrain suggests that the Shan people were located in the Qilung Mountains, north of Jen-chuan in China and south of Chenxi. Dr. Gribson also believes that the original habitat of the Tai is north of the Yangtze and Huangho in north-western China. According to La Copari, Chinese language, art, science, and elements of social structure were acquired from the Agra-Altec Bok people from West Asia. The acquisition of these elements required the help of highly educated and cultured people, and the Chinese were assisted in this by the neighboring Susians. These teachings were accompanied by the imprint of Babylonian civilization and were reformed. La Copari said the young Chinese were strong and powerful and were able to drive out the Bok or Pehshing (name for Chinese immigrants) people who migrated to China and dominate the country. Again, the idea that the Tai are of Mongolian origin may be said to have arisen from this view of La Copari. However, this theory of La Copari has been challenged by BJ Terwil. He says, “This</content>

<content>The author is unsure whether the Tai were in the coup colonies. He wants to create a rumor that the Tai people are of Mongolian origin just to popularize the doctrine.” Rev. William Clifton Dodd, an American missionary who spent a long time in Thailand on missionary work, talked to different people, observed the languages and cultures of different ethnic groups and studied the writings of missionaries, British and French scholars, said that they were the oldest inhabitants of China The Tai are often referred to as the &amp;#39;Lao&amp;#39; in ancient history. They migrated to the south several times and were eventually driven south by the Mangals under Kublai Khan Dad also says that the present-day Tai are the Shans of the west and the &amp;#39;Shyam&amp;#39; of the south and that they formed several powerful kingdoms in the northern temperate region from 2200 BC to 1234 BC He mentions that the Chinese and the Tai were brothers according to the view that the Chinese and the Tai were of the same ethnic origin Civilization China used to have 12 states and later decreased to nine</content>

<content>b is the value. Of these nine kingdoms, the Chinese were in only one, and the Tai dominated all the others. Although all the dynasties that ruled China except the Han are referred to as &amp;#39;Tai&amp;#39; on the basis of these Chinese records, the reliability of these records is not beyond doubt. Scholar Mote says that writers such as Terian and Cochrane have tried to give the status of the &amp;#39;Tai&amp;#39; ethnic group to everyone except the Han ethnic group in China. In this case, it is easy to refer to Taimang and Ai-Lao. They dominated the Yunnan Empire south of the Yangtze River and later the Yunnan Empire. Modern scholars have unanimously rejected Terion&amp;#39;s description of the physical appearance of the Tai (even before the twentieth century BC) and the theory that the people were identified as the Pa people of China. Tai People: Uprising and Migration As mentioned above, there is no reliable source in history or archeology to prove that the Tai are of Mongolian origin. There is also no reliable evidence that the Tai lived within a thousand miles of Mongolia or in the Altai Mountains. Secondly, the Tai people live in summer-dominated and rainfed cropland. Their traditional houses are decorated tall. Therefore, they cannot settle in desert-like climates like northern China or Mongolia. Scholars who have looked at the physical structure and heredity of the Tai and the Astro-Asians have been forced to admit that they have physical similarities to the A-Asians, not the Chinese. They are mentioned when we talk about the Yunnan Empire of Nan Chao between the eighth and thirteenth centuries</content>

<content>The Tais revolted. The idea that this Nan Chau was a Tai empire has only recently been established. Perhaps only itinerant European historians sought to prove this idea in the middle of this century. Prince Damrong, on the other hand, refuses to accept this idea as true. In 1914, he wrote that only European historians tried to give the impression that the Tai were inhabitants of Nan Chau. However, there is no historical source. In 1885, La Copari wrote an article entitled The Cradle of the Shan Race, which stated that the Nan Chau Empire was founded by the Thais. His new theory had a far-reaching impact and even made its way into textbooks in countries such as Thailand. After extensive research, a Chinese historian named Zhang Jil found that the Bai people living in Dali and Lake Erhai were closely related to the Baiman (or Heman or Ehaman) people who lived in Nan-Chau and Dali during the Tang and Chang dynasties. In other words, the Hemans of the Nan Chau and Dali empires are the ancestors of the Bai people. They have settled in the border area of southeastern China for nearly a thousand years and have contributed to the economy and culture of the area. Most of the high-ranking officials of Nan-Chau belong to the Baiman tribe. The kings and councilors of the Dali Empire belonged to the same ethnic group. He added that the Thai people have many differences in history, language, traditions and religion with this ethnic group. Therefore, Zhang Jilo comments that the Nan Chau Empire was not established by the Thais. His view is supported by another Chinese scholar, Hu Hura Seng. Seng says that the Dai live in Nan-chau</content>

<content>The Tai uprising is culturally completely different from that of the people. He says that the idea that she or the Dai founded the Nan-Chau kingdom is not true at all. At the Fourth International Conference of Tai Students in Kunming, China (1990), many Chinese and Tai scholars expressed the view that the Tai did not exist in Nan Zhao. These scholars, led by Chen Lu-far of Yunnan, said that the assumption that the Tai were originally Nanchau was wrong and misleading. Jean Barlic, on the other hand, insists that they are the original nan-chow. &amp;quot;Many Chinese scholars have mentioned that Oriental historians have made wrong comments about the existence of the Tai in Nan Zhao. But I say, yes, this Nan Zhao was the Tai Empire. The Association of Historians of Asia was formed in Hong Kong in the 1960s The issue of her non-existence in this place has since been discussed by Sen Lufan, Huang Hui Kun and Charles Kebas in Nan Zhao, but I strongly believe that this was the Tai kingdom, for example, supporting the former Bai doctrine. Similarly, Kebas has chosen the official Chinese view of the Tai as his basis. I accept that the Bai have linguistic similarities with the Tai, but these scholars have hindered all forms of ethnological study and research in Yunnan.” Tang history wants to give another fact. Between 824 BC and 835 BC, Nang (Nong) of northern Vietnam sought help from Nan Zhao several times. This refers to the relationship between her in the West and her in the East.

<content>The Tai coup relationship proves that Nan Zhao was once dominated by the Tai. In Yunnan and Nanzhao, no other ethnic force other than the Tai was able to establish such political and cultural relations. There are many similarities between the military and political organization of the Ahoms of Assam and those of the Tai people of Nan Zhao. Another notable aspect is that both the Nan Zhao and the Ahom used arrows, pikes and elephants in their wars. However, their spiritual development was late. Therefore, her name did not appear in Nan Zhao. The sixth or eighth empire was founded by Menges, the Shan or Lao (commonly known as the Man), who lived south of Dali. However, other Bai or Wii peoples were not able to develop political systems with strong socio-cultural structures like hers. A huge army of about 50,000 Tai landed in Vietnam and this was a difficult task for the other ethnic groups inhabiting Shan Zhao. Seng Tipen, a renowned researcher at the Yunnan Institute of Southeast Asia, acknowledged in 1993 that Nan Zhao was formerly dominated by the Tai. In earlier articles, he said that she did not exist in Nan Zhao and that the kingdom was under the Bai. In 1993, Burley&amp;#39;s article on the dominance of the Tai people in the feudal kingdom of the Meng Dynasty gave a new dimension to this research. According to him, King Ge Luafo of Manche was the successor of the Bai or Bi family and his political and military system was similar to that of the Bai. On the other hand, a study of the history of the Qadais reveals a new theme. The connection of the Thais with the Kadais is multi-layered. This is the case among the ancient Thai, Kadai and Indonesian peoples</content>

<content>Their coup is closely related. However, the Tai cannot be said to be of Chinese or Indian origin linguistically and ethnologically. The Tai have more genealogical ties to the Kadai and Indonesians than to the Chinese or Tibetan Burmans. However, this sequence has changed dramatically under Chinese influence. Lexical characteristics are also limited between Chinese and Tai, with only a few words being similar, which are not considered hereditary similarities. Indonesians, on the other hand, have a close vocabulary similarity to the Tai. Paul K. Benedict argues that although the direct connection of the Indonesians with the Tai cannot be established, a connection with the Kadai can be established. Benedict adds that there are similarities between her and Indonesians in terms of vocal characteristics. Another historian, Erik Seidenfaden, also says that they are by no means related to the Chinese. He says that somewhere in Yunnan the Tai separated from the Kadai-Indonesians. Crednar, after a study in Yunnan in 1935, commented that the Tai uprising took place in southern China He argues that the habitat of the Tai must be the equatorial region, where rice is produced in abundance; This is because this paddy or rice is their main food. The migration of the Tai to the equatorial zone or to the Yunnan plain did not come from the north, but from the former wetlands and the coast of southern China. Current Tai-related studies and research tend to focus on the coastal areas as opposed to the idea that Sezwan and Yunnan were the earliest habitats of the Tai. Researchers have turned their attention to the Yeh tribe that once inhabited these coasts.</content>

<content>The Uprising of the Tai Benedict, in his theory of language, refers to the Tai as of Kadai and Indonesian origin and concludes that the place of deviation of these three languages is Yunnan, the present residence of the Kadai. He believes that this Yunnan is the earliest settlement of the Tai. Examining various documents of Chu-Fan-Chi, without commenting on the Tai uprising, researcher Louis says that the Tai came to India-China from the northeast (the Kwangchi or northern Toking border), not from the northwest. Mote, a Chinese scholar, says that there is a lack of historical evidence to convince the Tai people of their infiltration through the Kwangxi Toking border. They were originally residents of the Tonkin area. However, due to the normal population growth, they moved towards the river valley. They advanced to the south of Guangzhou Province. According to Broman, an archaeologist, she is good at commenting on the origin of culture and language, but it is difficult to comment on the rise of the nation. They were well equipped under a commander to resist the enemy during the migration. This Murbri was their king in peacetime and their commander in wartime. They had to fight the Chinese for defence. and on the other hand they chose to attack the nations that lived in the places they went to. They learned this strategy from the Chinese. Whatever their military strategy and organization, their methods of warfare prove that they were very warlike. only</content>

<content>The Tai people&amp;#39;s entire history testifies to this, not during their migration to Southeast Asia. 14 However, the main and only reason for the migration of the Tai people was their refusal to accept the domination of the Han people. There are two main explanations for this – the first is demographic and the second is political. Initially, the demographics of the Han people did not influence the Tai until the century BC, but population growth at the end of this century made it necessary for them to produce monsoon crops to meet their food demands. For this they had to advance in search of flat land in the river valley. As it progressed, Tai culture developed among other ethnic groups and created a new cultural trend throughout Southeast Asia. They crossed many rivers when they migrated to the Indo-Chinese region. Their passage was facilitated by the Mekong and Saluin rivers. Crossing the Mekong, they established a small kingdom in northern Thailand and then another on the banks of the Chau Phraya River. The Tai, on the other hand, who migrated to the Chalui Na River Valley, adopted a system of rule modeled on the Shan Dynasty. The group that migrated to the Mekong River Valley split into several groups and moved south of the Mekong to the Chong Shu-Thai region of Tonkin. This region is in the southwest of northern Thailand. However, details of the history of the Tai people date back to the thirteenth century. The Tai chiefs established their rule in the river valleys and established their kingdom in the northern part of what is now Laos. They also settled in the southern part of the Mekong. of the borders of the Khmer Empire in northern Thailand at the time</content>

<content>Coup d&amp;#39;etat 15 They were able to advance southward due to weak rule. They soon gained political supremacy in what is now Thai Legu. The valleys of the Indus, Irrawaddy and Indus also gradually came under their control and they still dominate these places. Their migration to where the Tai people now live took place only in the thirteenth century. One group still dominates the fertile regions of the Brahmaputra Valley and the other the plains of Kwangchi. The territory inhabited by the Tai cannot be called a plain. Most of Unjani Lao and southern Burma were surrounded by high mountains and rivers, such as the Gyanjuri. That is probably why they could not come directly to this area. They had to come here through China. These mountains also prevented them from returning to China. It was not possible to maintain any link between the two Tai tribes settled in the Kwangxi Valley and the Tonkin Valley. Similarly, communication between the Tai tribes living in the Lao region, the Chinduin Valley and the Irrawaddy Valley was cut off. From the above discussion, it can be seen that the view that the Tai revolted off the coast of southeastern China is well-founded. The theory that they were the earliest dynasty in China is not credible. In the eyes of modern scholars, the Tai are actually inhabitants of the Yangtze River Valley and have linguistic and cultural similarities with the tribes of this valley.</content>

<content>16 Braman rightly says, “The views of earlier historians about the Thai and the Tai seem to be unfounded. Nineteenth-century historians have immediately rejected these theories and ideas Unfortunately, many contemporary writers have followed the views of these writers.” In this same way, many writers have promoted the Tai as civilized and Chinese royalty. Such doctrines are completely misleading. Studies of ancient Tai-speaking people have shown that Khulung and Khun Lai are their ancestors. The Tai scripture refers to it. They are also one of the gods of the Ahom. Therefore, this suggests the earliest settlement of the Tai people. According to ancient scriptures, the King of Heaven, Landon, sent two princes named Khulung and Khunlai to earth with a golden ladder and a council of ministers. Accordingly, Khulung and Khunlai descended the golden ladder and entered a deserted area of Murimuram! This Murimuram is the Munhi-Muham of the Shans. According to the scriptures, this Muhimungham is a place under heaven. When Khulung and Khunlai landed, they were warmly welcomed by the Tai people who lived nearby. (“I have sent you from heaven with these very necessary advices. They have already been sent and they are there,” said the heavenly king Landon to the two princes.) It says that Muhi and Muhar are located on the outskirts of Mongla in Sengmai province. Historically</content>

<content>The Tai uprising consists of Murrimurram Mongla, Mongyu, Mongkang and Mongpar and is located on the edge of Siengmai. 17 Therefore, scripturally, too, South China, especially Yunnan, is shown as the earliest residence of the Tai. In our opinion, the Tai arose in the southern part of Yunnan, the Shan kingdom, and parts of the northern kingdom of Siam. Ethnographically, it is evidenced as the habitation of early humans. However, it has not yet been possible to reach a consensus on this issue.</content>

<content>CHAPTER II Socio-Political Context of Thirteenth Century Kamrup and Significance of the Arrival of Chaolung Chu-ka-pha Before the arrival of Chaolung Chu-ka-pha, East Kamrup was under the tribal kingdoms. The Chutia kingdom established its capital at Shadia, east of the Sovansiri and Dichang and possibly along the banks of the Dikhou and Brahmaputra rivers. The Hirimbial Kacharis, one of the strongest branches of the Kacharis to the west of the Dikhou, ruled the kingdom with their capital at Dimapur on the banks of the Dhansiri. The kingdom of the Hirimbial Kacharis extended from the east of the Dikhou to the Kalang or south of the Brahmaputra and to the Dhansiri valley and the northern Kachar hills. Another one of the strongest branches of the Kacharis is the Dimasa Kacharis. They were completely different from the Boro Kacharis of today&amp;#39;s southern Assam. The Dimasa king Bicharpatipha, a contemporary of Tu-ka-pha, was known to be the son of the god Shiva. His kingdom extended to Mohang in the east, but Chu-ka-fai drove him to the hills east of Barhat and south of Jaipur and conquered his kingdom. The neighboring kingdoms of Charideo were the Maran and Barahi. Their total population was about four thousand and their kingdom was south of Charing and north of the kingdom of the Kacharis. They are the Marans</content>

<content>The socio-political of Kamrup in the 19th century then ruled the region bounded by the Budhi Dihing to the north, the Dichang to the south, the Chafrai to the east and the Brahmaputra to the west. Although they were scattered in this region, they were united under the leadership of their tribal chief Badaucha with their capital as their chief administrative centre. Chu-ka-fai faced severe resistance from some of the Marans but later he was able to conquer them through both forced repression and peaceful efforts. The Maran people were called Matak by Chu-ka-fai and Matak means &amp;#39;powerful man&amp;#39; in Tai language. While West Kamrup had a remarkable history of a kind of harmony between upper castes and tribals, the tools available for reconstructing the history of ancient Assam (Pragajyotish or Kamrup) are confusing and disorganized; However, it is known from the Ramayana and Mahabharata that the ancient Pragajyotish kingdom was much wider than the geographical area of modern Assam and certainly included Sylhet. The context of the Ramayana shows that the kingdom of Pragajyotisha extended to the Southern Sea. This fact is also supported by the Mahabharata. However, the true political history of ancient Assam begins with the kings of the Burman dynasty. Pushyavarman, the successor of the Varman dynasty of Narak Bhagadatta, was the first king of this dynasty. Therefore, the Burman dynasty probably began at least in the first century BC. In that sense, Narak and Bhagadatta actually established the first historical dynasty at that time. All the rulers of that period were the heirs of Narak and Bhagadatta until the end of the Pala dynasty. However, we cannot identify a direct relationship between the first Narak and Bhagadatta, although the latter was probably the son of the last Narak, who was a distant relative of the Bhouma dynasty founded by Narak. There are several references to hell in history, among them the Kalika Purana</content>

<content>The thirteenth century socio-political legend of Kamarupa included Naraka, a contemporary of Janaka and Banasura. During the reign of Bhutivarma, who ruled Kamarupa in the fifth century 20 BC, a significant attempt was made to Aryanize about three hundred Brahmins of various tribes in this border region. (References Bhutivarma&amp;#39;s Bar Ganga inscription, Harshacharita, Bhaskar Varma&amp;#39;s Nidhanpur copper plate). Various inscriptions and copper plates of the Bhoum Narak dynasty clearly show that although the local kings were Bhumiputra tribal kings and most of their subjects were tribal, they were highly Aryanized and became worshipers of the god Shiva and Goddess Parvati. They even patronized Brahmins from other parts of India. During the reign of Bhaskarvarma, Gaur was conquered and the lost glory of Kamarupa was restored to some extent (context: Nidhanpur copper plate of Bhaskarvarma). He made an alliance with the powerful king Harshavardhana which led to a link with the upper castes of Kanauj and a large number of them came to settle in Kamarupa. The Brahmins came to Assam mainly on their own initiative and in some cases at the invitation of the king who provided them with flexible facilities to stay in Assam. Most of the inscriptions before the thirteenth century dealt with the donation of land to Brahmins. Apart from the Brahmins, two other Aryan-speaking communities of the Caucasian ethnic group, the Kalitas and Kayastha, probably also migrated to Assam during the early AD century. There is no mention in the old history that the Kalitas entered Assam earlier than the Kayastha However, the word &amp;#39;Karan Kaystha&amp;#39; is found in some ancient inscriptions</content>

However, the Kalitas probably migrated in ancient times and through their contacts and blood mixtures with the people of the Tibetan Burmese language group (Kirat) they developed a culture of Aryan and non-Aryan beliefs, customs and lifestyles. The most notable ethnic groups among the Tibetan Burmese are the Kench (they are Hindu converts), Kachari (Baro Kachari, Dimasa Kachari, Sonwal Kachari, Mech, Rava and others, Chutia (Hindu convert Kachari), Deuri, Maran, Lalung etc. Kaystha The Barbhuyas were all Hindus and the Brahmins brought with them people of higher descent who helped them not only in agriculture but also in worship The steady Hinduisation of the Tibeto-Burman people dur.ing the ancient period brought about a Sanskritisatic of the local pre-Aryan names of both Sino-Tibr and Austric origin in bringing them in line Brahmanical Hindu notions and religious notio rent among the people Sacred places Hindu religious world were grand myths and legends which w Indirect influence of the 66 21</content>

<content>They knew about the Shans and therefore accepted Ghu-ka-pha as their over lord without protest. The Kacharis were numerous and widespread, but the Ahoms did not voluntarily accept their trust. Su-ka-fai did not do so with the Chutia either. The most active aspect of the Ahom&amp;#39;s connection with the local tribes was that the local tribal people easily accepted the Ahom and this shows that the Maran and Barahi, whose diet was very similar to the Ahom, were the same tribal people. They prepared dinner and ate all kinds of food except beef. In the early thirteenth century, the region of Kamrup was not deeply Hinduized as it was not dominated by Brahmins and upper castes. The Maran or Mataks were originally Tai-speaking (Phu-Kao an Kao) but later merged with the Kacharis. In the thirteenth century, the religious practice of the Bhumiputras of this region was mainly centered on the worship of Shiva and Parvati in various forms and images. In Western Assam, however, there were distorted practices of Buddhism and fellow Buddhists. The Maran, Chutia, Deuri and Kacharis worshiped Shiva and the goddess Kechai Khati; Other tribal groups worship Shiva and Goddess Parvati as Budha-Budhi (Maran), Shivarai Heremedi (Dimasa), Fa Mahadeumhamaya (Tiwa), Shiva-Parvati (Deuri), Batho Barai-Siri (Baro), Shilpamahakal Durga (Rajbanshi), Langa-Kechaikhati (Rava). (Sonwal) and other names. The most important aspect of the religious beliefs of the people of Assam was that there was never any conflict between the worshipers of Shiva and Goddess Parvati. At that time, people did not know the name of Lord Vishnu, either</content>

<content>24 The socio-political of Kamrup in the thirteenth century... No. The Barahis worshiped Shiva and Parvati as well as Vishnu. Not surprisingly, Madhava Kandali, in writing the Assamese Ramayana with Lord Rama as the central character, depicted Ramachandra as an incarnation of Lord Vishnu. It is said that Charideo was a place of worship of the Barahis and probably both the kings and subjects worshiped there to please Lord Vishnu. This indicates that the Barahis became Aryanized to some extent in the thirteenth century. It is said that the worship of Vishnu on the north bank of the Brahmaputra spread to such an extent that the local kings gave land to Brahmins from outside the kingdom to obtain the blessings of Vishnu. These Brahmins of the Habung region wrote the &amp;#39;Satyanarayana Vrata Katha&amp;#39; which is said to have gained great popularity among the people of Bengal. This shows that the religious beliefs of most of the tribal peoples of Kamrup were dominated by Lord Shiva and Goddess Parvati, who were named by different names. The Brahmin community, on the other hand, was a follower of the strict Hindu system of worship and as most of them had migrated from Bengal, their religious practice was mainly influenced by the Bengal Brahmin system of worship. The tribal priesthood (Janthai) worshiped Lord Shiva and Goddess Parvati in their traditional ways and some tribes also sacrificed goats, chickens, ducks, etc. to Lord Shiva; In contrast, according to Hindu Brahminical law, sacrifice was forbidden in Shiva worship. In the thirteenth century, religious deviation reached such a climax that even human sacrifices were offered in the worship of Goddess Parvati under the patronage of local tribal chiefs and kings. According to available information, human sacrifice was practiced among some hill tribes until the 1950s</content>

<content>The thirteenth century was the Samati Political.... 25 of Kamrup. It is also true that the narratives of the Ramayana and Mahabharata were popular among the people of Assam. However, the Brahmins of Western Assam were often strict followers of Hindu customs and followed the ten reforms of the Smriti-Shastra school that prevailed in Kamrup from ancient times to the eighteenth century. In the eighteenth century, this movement developed into a marginal religious movement in eastern Assam under the influence of the Raghunandan sect, which was also influenced to some extent by the Parbatia and Muklimuria Gosai families sponsored by the Ahom royal family. At the time of the arrival of Chu-ka-pha in the thirteenth century, there were almost no Brahmin families in the eastern part of Assam. Among the hardliners, the voice of the local people on the reform ceremonies from birth to marriage and death There was no concept of any reform festival. However, these festivals were celebrated in the same way as the Brahmins in the Kayastha, Kalita and other societies. At death, the body was cremated instead of buried! Purification ceremonies were observed among all the tribes. However, the Ahom came and introduced the custom of burying the dead in the tomb and with it the custom of extensive reform ceremonies. This rare method of burial is comparable to the Egyptian mummy method. When Chu-ka-fa entered East Kamrup, he brought with him the religious beliefs of the Tai people. They also brought with them the worship of their ancestors. They believe that after death, man becomes God. They did not have the belief in reincarnation among Hindus, even among the tribes of Assam. The Ahom believe that after death and Me-Dam-Me-Biswa, people go to heaven step by step and live in heaven with their relatives. It is an extraordinary of the Ahom</content>

<content>The socio-political of Kamrup in the thirteenth century.... Belief. The main deities of the Ahom in religious activities are Landon, Lankuri, Jachingpha, Ai Leng Din, Khaokham, Janchai Hung, Lauthri, Pujakji, Chitkamcham, etc. Along with these, there are also the sun gods (Khunban) and the moon gods (Khun-dun). The Ahom also believe in an almighty God (whom they call Fa Tu Ching from Hum). The religious festivals of the Ahom were Umpha, Me-Dam Mephi, Furalung, Rikskhan, etc. There were no temples of the Ahom gods except Chomdeu. Chomdeu was the main idol of the Ahom kings and could only be touched by the kings. Along with Chu-ka-pha, the beliefs or concepts of the old men and the gods associated with mountains, rivers, etc. came to Assam. At that time, however, the Ahom had not come into contact with the Brahmins and therefore there was no attempt to identify the gods and goddesses of the Ahom and the Hindus. That work was done only towards the end of the Ahom Empire. Therefore, there was no conflict between Hindu and Ahom religions during the reign of Chu Ka-pha and the local people could practice their religion fearlessly and impartially. Another great contribution of Chu-ka-pha was in agriculture. Chu-ka-fa was very skilled in irrigation. He was well aware of the aspects to be considered when selecting land for permanent agriculture and settlement, as evidenced by his measurement that the weight of the southern stream of the Dikhou River was twice that of the lower stream of the Dikhou River. He did not stay everywhere when he went abroad to Habung, Dimau, Shimluguri etc. and seeing the muddy ground, he did not stay in Timon. Because he saw the possibility of flooding. Therefore, he settled permanently in Charideo, surrounded by abundant agricultural land without the risk of flooding. He is a gashikala, a barkhowa</content>

At that time, the Assamese people did not know the method of rice cultivation except in Barbhuiya in West Assam and on the north bank of the Brahmaputra. The Barbhuiyans plowed with cows in irrigation, did not use oxen and were not aware of irrigation methods. Khuka-fai saw that the people living in Souma Peeth (Maran, Barahi, Kachari, Chutia, Deuri, etc.) did not know how to plow and only sowed paddy by setting fire and cultivating jhum. He saw that the Barahi and Maran people had spacious yards, fenced their houses and raised goats, pigs, chickens, ducks, etc. But they did not know the techniques of irrigation. So he introduced the method of irrigation and plowing with a ya mohai. He brought with him seeds of sticky Bora rice from his motherland and introduced it in Assam. This new agricultural method was easily adopted by the Maran and Barahi people and introduced irrigation. It revolutionized paddy cultivation in East Assam and the irrigation system as well as the irrigation system by building small alleys in the fields gained great popularity by awakening the innovative power of the local farmers. They started raising me and cows for irrigation as the local tribal people did not eat cow or cow milk. Thus, Chu-ka-fai changed the nature of rural life in Eastern Assam and provided a simple livelihood for the people which paved the way for a prosperous Assam. His Majesty Chu-ka-fai and even his Prime Minister Buragohain married Barahi and Maran girls according to necessity. The unmarried soldier feudal lords followed the same path and the local girls who accepted the Ahom waters were called Chu-ka-fai</content>

<content>The thirteenth century socio-political of Kamrup... taught me to raise the seedlings I brought with me Therefore, a prosperous environment for the manufacture of Assamese silk, velvet and jute developed in Assam from the days of Chu-ka-pha. It developed in such a way that during the Ahom Empire, the Assamese people did not need to import clothes from abroad. A firm foundation of the silk industry was established in Assam. It is not that the local people were unaware of the silk industry. In fact, the Barahi, Kachari, Deuri, Chutia etc. knew how to make cotton yarn and garments or eddy yarn and garments and added another dimension to the silk industry by introducing Chuka-fai velvet larvae and velvet yarn. 28 - Chu-ka-fai also introduced the Assamese style house. There is a legend about this. The story goes that one day a man of the Chutia community came to Chu-ka-pha with a bird&amp;#39;s nest in the shape of two slanted-skinned birds in the modern Assamese style. Tu-ka-pha liked the shape of the structure and introduced the same pattern in the residences of the kings and ministers. He issued orders that the common people would live in slanted houses as they had done before. Therefore, the &amp;#39;Assam-style house&amp;#39; was introduced according to the policy introduced by Chu-ka-fa. During the reign of Chu-ka-pha, the tribal people of East Assam celebrated various cultural festivals centered on harvesting crops besides religious festivals celebrating the worship of gods and goddesses like Kechaikhati, Shiva, Budha Budhi etc. The Bihu festival was also celebrated informally among the local people, as it was limited to song and dance. The locals played large and long drums, but the Ahoms introduced medium drums and over time</content>

<content>The socio-political of Kamrup in the thirteenth century.... This type of drum not only became popular but also gained permanence. Garu Bihu was also probably introduced in Assam by Du-ka-fai. It is noteworthy that playing the drums was essential during Umpha and Chomdeu Puja. The custom of giving long blessings during the singing of Huchari is probably derived from the custom given by the Ahom in the Tai language. In fact, the custom of singing Huchari was probably introduced by the Ahom. There is no Magh Bihu among the Maran and Barahi people during the reign of Chu-ka-pha, which suggests that this festival is also a contribution of the Ahom people. The Tai state Chu-ka-fai introduced the ancient system of rule of the Tai people in southern Burma and southern China when he came to Assam. As the bearer of her tradition, Chu-ka-fai appointed a chief administrator in each of the regions he occupied. Probably in accordance with her policy of administrative division, she also introduced the system of governing the administrative system of Assam by dividing it into regions, provinces or districts. Each province or district appointed an administrator called Rajkhowa (Fukin Mu). The administrative system he introduced was a kind of monarchy in which only a male member of the royal family and the children of the king could claim the throne. The administrative system was organized on the basis of succession with the king followed by the council of ministers (Burgohai, Bargohai). After the cabinet were the chief administrators of the provinces. The administrative system of the cabinet is similar to that prevailing in the eastern Maulung or Mummit and other Tai states. After the death of the king in the absence of sons, the council of ministers administers the kingdom until a prince of the same lineage can be appointed to the throne according to the tradition. Throughout the Ahom rule, there was never a situation where ministers had to sit on the throne because they</content>

Hu Ka Fai introduced this characteristic system of rule which continued to the end. The administrative system was ubiquitous and even officers were appointed to carry out administrative work down to the grassroots. The Ahom had no permanent army but a special system was established for every healthy man to perform compulsory military service. This system enabled the young men to remain healthy and ready for battle at all times. Hu-ka-fai introduced gunpowder and cannons from Maulung to the martial arts of Assam. The kings of Kamarupi did not know how to use bartops and gunpowder. They used only bows, arrows, knives, sticks and elephants. The introduction of gunpowder and cannons revolutionized martial arts. In terms of clothing and jewellery, Chu-ka-fai introduced the first shoes and nara cholas (Tai clothes). The jewelery he brought with him included jangfai, jonbiri, various pearls, etc. and the costumes included kingkhap, Ahom mekhela, various velvet dresses, etc., and the utensils included maihang, banbati, bankanhi, etc. Another notable contribution of Chu-ka-pha to Assamese culture is the Hengdang. In the days of the Kamarupi kings, it was not customary to record the flow of royal events. Therefore, we have to rely on inscriptions, copperplates etc. for sources of history. Ghu-ka-fai introduced the first practice of writing history. Ahom history tells us that Chu-ka-fai ordered the scholars of the Kham Yang kingdom he had established to record the truth of everything the king said, did and saw and to continue this practice.

<content>The thirteenth century socio-political.... This is the beginning of the practice of writing the history of the state in a scientific and systematic manner. There is nothing unusual in the fact that the Assamese nation can be proud of its historical literature as there is no other example of systematic history writing in the entire country like Assam. Hu-ka-fa&amp;#39;s most important contribution was the social and religious harmony he advocated. He never wanted to impose religion on his subjects or force them to adopt a language. His initiatives in this regard were reflected in the generosity, religious and social tolerance shown by the Ahom kings during these hundred years of Ahom rule, and the Assamese language developed as a common language and the people united as an Assamese nation. When Chu-Ka-Fa came to Assam, the Assamese nation had not even sprouted and people identified themselves by caste and tribe instead of caste. There is a lot of information in the Ahom history about how Chu-ka-fai united the people of East Assam and paved the way for the formation of the Assamese nation. First he made alliances with the kings of Maran and Barahi by marrying their daughters. They forced the Marans who refused to accept their rule to accept it by force. Others made alliances and some of them were included in the Ahom clan. While living in Tipam near the Dihing River, he was attracted to a Matak who supplied him with eggplant. Hu-ka-fai named it Lanmakhru (eggplant mother in Ahom language). Lanmadhuru also helped in many ways during the war with the Nagas. In reward, Chu-ka-fai included him in the Ahom clan. Lanmakhru is a special later known by his name</content>

(ABP-34) was kind to them and employed them as potters, water carriers, reservoir keepers, doctors and storekeepers. Thus, during the reign of Chu-ka-pha, a process of unity began and the Assamese nation was formed which developed fully during the next six hundred years of the Ahom rule.</content>

The origin of the Ahom can be briefly described in the Ahom Buranji and Pak Pen Ka Ka that God created a god named Khuntheukham from his chest. A lotus flower came out of Khuntheukham&amp;#39;s navel; A crab and a frog wrapped in a snake with eight hoods were also created. Mountains have been created on the north and south sides and pillars have been erected on them. He created a pair of golden spiders and the spiders threw their feces down while flying in the sky to create the earth. Makbahal created a paradise in the shape of a golden throne. Then God created a female goddess and gave her the keys. After Thaolung had incubated the ears for many years, he sprinkled some nectar on the eggs and the eggs hatched. Then ,his four sons were Fachangdin Khunniu (lord of Marat), Kheng Chakakaka (lord of eight lakh snakes in the water) and Sheng-kamba (of eight-leaved multi-leaves) respectively</content>

After his death, Sheng-Kampha became a demon for acting against his father&amp;#39;s will. His son Shenkapha became king and after his death the house became beautiful God looked down from heaven and saw that there was no wise man to guide His children. So he created a wise man named Hun-Khamgan and instructed him to go to a place covered with the mist of heaven and live there. He was entrusted with the task of writing the laws. Another (with wings) named Fuka was also created. Ninngaokham (Phura) was in the north and, shining like a king, was lying on the north pole, absorbed in deep meditation. Pufichai came down from Rungrai with nine thousand servants to meet Ningaokham. Puficha brought him to Mu-kling-khu and made him its king. He was named Fabu-Irungchamdam. His youngest son, Fasiip-Changdin, became king of Fakaokhur. Of his four sons, the eldest was Yinging (king of the fairyland). The youngest, Chaodakham (king of Mulai and Umung), married a princess named Nangchengdao. Among the sons of the surgeon of Chaodakham, a three-headed boy named Fachangpao drowned. His youngest son, Giringkham, was also called Landon and Cyrepha because he was born of the Shendam flower. Langdon had a beautiful sister named Shangshwengzhao who married a prince named Dakham. One of Langdon&amp;#39;s brothers was Sengtao Nuwo Kaifa Thunkham (King of Mufi). His son; Chengtao Non Kaipha Thenkham sent his sons Khulung and Khun Lai to rule the earth by order of Landon, King of Heaven. 38 Chao Dakham was the father of Landon and Landon&amp;#39;s sister was married to him.

<content>The history of Chaolungchu-ka-pha and his successors... Some histories written in Assamese attempt to identify Landon as Indra and Jahingpha as Saraswati. From the late sixteenth century, the Brahmins brought by the Ahom kings to worship the Hindu gods and goddesses tried to Aryanize the Ahom kings and officials and created myths and legends that they had links with the Vedic god Indra. The Brahmins, taking the Gungsutra from the history written in the Tai Ahom language, try to say that after the god Indra (king of heaven) was cursed by Rishi Bashishta, he took the form of a demon and married a demon (actually a goddess). According to Hindu scriptures, the stories were created around Indra, the king of heaven. and attempts were made to prove that the Ahom kings were Hindus. The story that Kankati gave birth to Thenkham (as a result of intercourse with Indra during her menstrual period) can be rejected as an attempt to prove that the Ahom kings were Aryans Landon sent Pushichu to rule the forests of the earth by living in a large tree. Landon ordered the two princes to satisfy Pushi in the presence of all the people Khun Lai gave him a box containing an idol of a great goddess and asked him to keep it carefully. He then gave the two princes a toothed elephant, a pair of Kaichengmu (holy land chickens), a flowery cloth, a pair of drums, a sword (Hendang). They placed an idol and said that the box should never fall to the ground and in the past, Falaibet (God) gave the idol to Fabung Changdam (Fura).</content>

On an auspicious day in the month of Magh (Dinsham), both the princes must bathe in perfumed water, wear clean clothes and go to the temple of Chungphakangmung without putting anything in their mouths. After the two kneel before the altar of God in the temple, the two princes must wash the idol with water and drink some of it. Then they must put the idol back in the box and close the lid. They must not let anyone else see the idol. Chomdeo is described in detail in the chapter entitled “The Religion of the Ahoms.” Landon wanted princes to rule over the land full of tais and slaves on earth They went down a golden ladder and sat on the golden throne. All the kings, including Khuntun, were spread out over their heads They sat around two people and brought three thousand pots of food for three people. The country was called Murimuram (meaning abandoned place). They built villages in the valley and fed them. The two princes ran the country well.

They all lived in Murimura and lived on the produce of the vast fields Ot Khulung and Khun Lai forgot to bring the heavenly chicken plow and the sword. Khulung and Khunlai did not want to climb the long ladder back to heaven to fetch the goods, let alone others. An enthusiastic man named Langu agreed to bring two pounds of goods on condition that he gained control of Khe (Yunnan). Langu went to heaven and first met Jahingpha. Jachingphai asked him to entice the two princes to eat the thigh bones of the heavenly chickens. The sword was attached to a pole near the king&amp;#39;s seat and placed in the middle of the house. Jasingphai said that after sacrificing a cow, they could only play the drum during war, not at other times. Langu brought back the things right but told the two princes the opposite. He wanted to keep the sword in his hands and said that was the wish of Jahingfar. He asked the two princes to accept the thigh bones of the chickens and said that Jasingphai wanted the kingdom of Khe to be given to him. The two princes did as Langu said. Perhaps the evil-minded Langu wanted to rule the kingdom as far as the sea border and caused conflict between the two princes by giving some evil advice to the younger prince Khun Lai to seize the throne. The day after Langu&amp;#39;s return, the two kings together planted a tree to mark the coronation of the elder and returned to the palace after distributing salt among the people. Then, without his brother&amp;#39;s knowledge, Khula went to the big tree and tied some gold wires to the roots of the tree. One day he hit his brother</content>

<content>Chaolung Ch&amp;#39;u Ka-fa, the history of his successors... He is the true king of Muram. Khulung was saddened by his brother&amp;#39;s conspiracy and left the kingdom and returned to heaven. When he went and told Landon everything, Landon became angry and cursed Khun Lai that Khun Lai would die extinct. He then advised Khulung to re-establish his kingdom in Munkhumunja (ie the great empire of the Great Prince). Khulung reigned with great glory and became popular. Later, he divided his kingdom among his sons. His eldest son was made king of Taitamkang. His son Khun Phak was made king of Muntiu (Southern Country) and he was required to supply Khulung with one million horses annually. The third son, Khundu, was made king of Lamungtai and paid rent in elephants. Another son, Khunkakpha, was made king of another large kingdom and was required to send 100,000 coins a year. Khulung was ordered to pay tribute with precious stones and elephants annually and another son, Khunla, was left in Abha to rule Burma. Khulung kept with him one of his sons, Khunchu, as his successor. He was well taught and explained by Khunlung and transferred to him the swords and drums given to him by Langdon. Khunlung also told him about the fight with his brother and how he had received his golden throne from Landon. Khulung told his son not to disrespect the throne and not to disobey Landon. During his forty years of rule, Khulung extended his vast empire from northern Shyam Chengmai in the east to the neighboring Lohit (Brahmaputra River) in the west and the mountainous regions of Assam. It is the southern region of Burma, a part west of Mekptar and probably south of Avar as well as the fertile land</content>

<content>Chaolungchu-ka-fa, the history of his successors... included the Empire. However, there is no mention in the Ahom history of the extent to which Khunlung extended his actual empire. However, it can be assumed that the Tai people under Khulung and other leaders attempted to conquer the southern part of Burma at that time. The eldest son of Khulung, known as Ai-khun-sung, must be Tao-lung-pa-tao Lu-lo. It is also noteworthy that after being deceived by his brother Khun Lai, Khunlung went to heaven to meet Landon and seek his advice. He left his son Tao-long-pa-tao-lu-lok king of Muri-muram. After his return from heaven, he established the kingdom of Mu-Khuch-Mu-Yao and left the kingdom of Muri-Muram. His seventh son, Khun Chu, succeeded Khulung as his successor at Mukhkhu Muzao. The capital of Mu-ri-muram was Lai-dai. Khulai reigned there for seventy years. After his death, his son Chao-i-jip (Tao-i-jep-tat-fa of Tamuliphukan and I-dep-tat-fa of Nei Elias) ascended the throne in 638 AD and reigned for forty years. The new era of the famous Ai Zep Lakni or Mao Chan began in the year Chao Ai Zep ascended the throne. I. Jeppe died in 678 AD. The throne was vacant as he had no heir. Therefore, the ministers and officials went to Chao-Khun-Jun (Khuchur), the ruler of Mu-Kho-Mujao, and told him everything and asked him to send a prince of his descendants to rule the kingdom. Chao-khun-jun sent his son Kham-pong-pha there. After reigning for five years, he died in 703 AD, leaving his eldest son Kham Tap-pha as his heir. 80</content>

<content>Chaolung Chu-ka-fa, the history of his successors... In the same year, Kham Tappha&amp;#39;s brother Kham Typ-fai-mu-mao-lung took over and established his capital at Ma Kao Mu Lung (Maolung). (1: Introductory sketch of the History of the Shans: N.Elias: 1876) But according to Ne Elias, Kham Tap Fai (Elias Kamchip Fa) succeeded his brother in 703 AD and established his capital at Mao-Kao-Mu-Lung, boycotted Mu-bi-sung-ram as his capital. Historically, Chao Ijeg ascended the throne in 638 AD and ruled for 40 years. Thus, in the seventh century, the first significant succession of Tai power occurred in the Mekong Valley and southern Burma. Dr. Kuching points out that the Tai people migrated from the Yushman Mountains in the south to the Nam-Chao (Shelley River) Valley and its adjacent areas in the sixth century AD. Almost the entire Shelley Valley became the home of the Shans and the seat of political power. From this region the Tai extended to the north, west and southeast. Thus not only the valley but the entire region between the Mekong and the Irrawaddy, including the Shan states of Burma, came under the control of the Tai group known as the Mao-Khan. However, this is found only in the histories of the Shans, which are not entirely accurate and in some cases unreliable. The significance of I-jep-lakni is that it gives a historical date for the coronation of Chao I-zep, son of Ju Lai, as king of Mu-bi-murom. “The Ahom history is characterized by the accession of the first Ahom king Mukafa to the throne in 1228 AD</content>

However, this king sent a group of Nara astrologers and scholars to Mogang to examine the histories of their kingdom in the hands of the Khan Buddhist priests there and to see evidence of the books (and customs) brought to this country by Sukapha After experimentation, those scholars wrote a new Ahom history in Assamese and mentioned the establishment of the first Shan capital on the banks of the Sheli River, starting with the Assam expedition of Cham-lu-far. In doing so, they left behind two quotes, either of which can be considered the beginning. . The first thing is that astronomers and other scholars calculated that eleven Tao Chinga (ages) had passed from the time Khulung-Khun Lai descended from heaven and established the kingdom until Chukapha ascended the throne of southern Assam. The second is that these Burmese people began their national era during the reign of the Mau king Ai Jep (or Ai Jep-Tatpha). Now if we subtract one Tao-Chinga or 660 years from 1228 AD, ie from the time of Chukapha&amp;#39;s accession to the throne, we get 568 AD The rule of I-Jep, initiated by the Shans, began in the 70th year of the establishment of Muri Muram (568+70=638 AD). This year is considered to be the beginning of the Burmese National Era Thus, I-Jep-Lakni has historical significance; This is because it has given place to the mythical characters Khun-Lung and Khun-Like#history.

<content>History of Chaolungtu Ka-pha, his successors... We have studied the history of &amp;#39;Ahom Ruranji&amp;#39; and Kashinath Tamuliphukan and have come to the conclusion that the dynasty of Sukapha is as follows. 80 * Khulung had many sons. Among them, Khunchu became king of Mukho-Mujang. After Khulung ruled for 40 years, his son Khunchu became king. Another son of Khulung, Khunkhapha, was king of the kingdom of Julung or Mujong. Khun Chu died after reigning for 25 years. Khuchu was succeeded by his son Chao Chengchao, who ruled Mukhong-Mujang for 15 years. He was succeeded by his son Tao Khujun. Meanwhile, Khun Lai died after ruling Murimuram for 70 years and his son Tao I-Jep-Taopha became king. He reigned 40 years and died childless. Thus came the end of the Khun Lai dynasty. On the death of I-Zep, his council of ministers appointed Khampangpha, a descendant of Khulung, king of Muri-Muram. The main historical event during the reign of I-Zep is the beginning of the Tai cycle of growth called I-Zep-Lakni. The 60-year Tai cycle began in 638 AD. This year also marks the beginning of the Burmese year cycle. Therefore, it can be considered an important historical fact. After ruling for 25 years, Khampongpha made his eldest son Khamtappha king of Murimuram. He made his youngest son Khamtyppha king of Maolung. After 50 years, Khamtippha&amp;#39;s son Niphamao became king. Forty years later, Sakhunpha, son of Niphamao, became king. Chukaipha became king after 41 years of rule. Chuhenpha became king after 34 years. Thirty-three years later, his son Sutaopha became king. After 32 years, his son Chupatpha became king. After 27 years, Suan-fa became king. Twenty-three years later, his son Chahanpha became king. Twelve years later, his son Chamuhaoka became king. 19 years later, his son Chulip-fa became king. After 21 years of rule, Chalippha died childless</content>

Twelve years later, his son Tyao Lulu became king. After 19 years of rule, his son Chao Changbun (Tao Tangmun of Tamuliphukan) became king. His son Chao Chengnyu was in Murimuram at the time of his death. So another son, Tao Chinga, becomes king. Eleven years later, his brother Tao Luchu (Tao Lulu of Ahom history) became king. His brother Tangaklem (Tangachu of Tamuliphukan) succeeded him and reigned for eight years. Tao Khanubin then reigned for 18 years. Tao Khukum then reigned for eight years. During his reign, the king of Maolung, Thao Khura, was forced to leave Maolung and gave the Maolung kingdom to Khunkum. Khunkum made his son Tao Taiyung (Taipung) king of the kingdom. Taiplung divided his kingdoms among his sons The eldest son, Ai Tailung, was given the kingdom of Mujin, the youngest son, Cham Fuchangkhang, was given the kingdom of Mummit, and the youngest son, Ni Pameopung, was given the kingdom of Maolung. 88 Chao Chang-nyuo was the son of the great Chao Chang-bun. He came from Murimuram by the same route that Khulung Tuwak&amp;#39;s grandson Khun-lu-chio came to Lakni Raimit. He arrived and entered Muthumuja, then Mombamba Mukhan and Qingchen Mao-lung respectively. &amp;quot;You shall not cross the Nam-kyu River. We are of the same heavenly lineage. We have come down from heaven together, eaten meat together, gone to the same stomach The ornaments should be wrapped in the same cloth.” He then handed over his younger sister Nangmu-rak-kham-cheng, who was born to the same parents, to Chao Changnyu. Chao Tai Pung was the maternal father of Chao Lung-Chukapha. (3-Chaoluo Chu-ka-yar Bashelara see Appendix 1)</content>

Then he left the kingdom of Mu Maolung forever, taking with him Khunba, Bu Khun-ring, Khun Cheng, and Khun-fu-kin-mu. Then Chu-ka-ba went to his ancestral kingdom of Mukho-mu-ja. He also took with him the family immovable property inherited from his father&amp;#39;s kingdom, the Chumuk Rangmure idol, the symbol of the Bulung dynasty.

Many of the Khas died and many fled. The meat of the warriors was cut and roasted and fed to their own brothers and sisters. They were terrified and became the refugee subjects of the conqueror Glu-ka-far. Chaolu Chu-ka-fai crossed the Dai-kao Rang Mountains and came along the Nam-pung River to the banks of the Nam-ruk (Namrup) River. He sailed with three thousand horses on a mule built by the Kha tribe and reached the river Nam Jin. He collected many weapons of war and proceeded along the banks of the Nam Jin River to Mulla Khen Ten Cha. In the year of Rayangi Lakni, Fa-sung-khun-tud was placed there. Chu-ka-fai crossed the Nam-jin River and arrived at Tipam. Tipam was not considered very suitable for settlement as it was often flooded. Therefore, Chu-ka-fai crossed the Jin River again and found Mu-bung-che-glu In time, he settled there. This place was a jungle place. He later crossed the Ti-Lao (Brahmaputra) again and entered Mu Habung. He settled in Habung during the years of Dap Keo, Rai-Seo and Mu Plau Lakni. He spent three years there farming. Habung was also a flood-hit area, so he crossed the Brahmaputra again to the mouth of the Nam Chao (Dikhou) river and traveled north along the Dikhou. When he reached the mouth of the Nam Khun (Dichang) river and measured its water, he learned that the river flowed from Tipam and went up through Nam-chao (Dikhou) to the kingdom of Mu-rui-mu-chen. There he measured the water of the Chantak River and found it twice as heavy as the Nam-chao (Dikhou).</content>

<content>Chaolung Cha-ka-fa, the history of his successors... On sailing, he reached Khen Tun Niu (Shimluguri) and had a feast with his officials with beef and food. He did not want to stay there when he learned that there were three hundred ghats at Namdang and Charing according to the information given by his surveyors. He lived in Shimla during the years of Khutsi, Kanchao, Tao-chi-nga, Ka-mut Kapchan, Dap Rao Lakni and then crossed the Tomk River. In the year 8b of Rai Mit, he founded the city of Lang Tao Fat. They leave the fields open, they leave the palace. They celebrate the Rik-Rin-Mu festival with ceremony. The area was a flood-hit area, so the city of Nakai was established in the mountains in the Mu-Kao Lakni year. The city was very beautiful, large in size and well decorated. One horse was buried in the name of the gods, one to the north and one to the south of the city. It was also wrapped in a tun-pang (big tree) with gold thread weighing four colors and a silver vessel was placed at the base of the tree. Then Me-Mu Me Ban was celebrated with a grand ceremony and settled there when the city was completed. Chaolung Chu-ka-fai established three Ana Tai kingdoms, Mu Kamta (Kamata), Mu-Tumisa (Kachari) and Mu-Tiura (Chutia) and three Tai kingdoms Khamjang (Tipam).

This is how the two brothers exchanged gifts. 8 Then the sacrifices of the gods of the countries and the kingdoms were held. This king ruled from this hill town for forty-one years. He passed away in the year Plek ni Lakni. He was buried at Charideo. After his death, his son Chu-Teupha became king (1268-1281).

<content>Chaolung Chu-ka-fa, the history of his successors... , was succeeded by his son Chu-khang-fa. After conquering the original inhabitants of the area where they settled, the population of the Ahom increased unexpectedly in the peaceful environment that prevailed for a long time. Such population growth cannot be attributed to natural processes alone; The integration of the indigenous people into the Ahom, and probably new migrations from the original settlements of the Ahom, also contributed to this growth. However, the growth of the population now brought them to a position where they could stand alone against the powerful kings around them. As a result, through several battles, they became an indispensable force in the entire Brahmaputra Valley. First they declared war against the king of Komata (certainly not the Koch kingdom) and the king of Komata immediately entered into a treaty and married his daughter Rajni to the Ahom king. In 1332, Chu-Khang-Fa died. Chu-Khram-Fa, the eldest of four sons, ascended the throne. He died in 1364 after reigning for thirty-two years. He was succeeded by his brother Chu-tu-fa in He was killed by the Chutia king by deception and conspiracy. to After his death, there was no prince to become king, and the Buragohai and Bargohai administered the kingdom. Later, in 1380, they made Tyao-kham-thik, brother of the heavenly king, king. He went to war to take revenge against the Chutia king and returned with victory and glory. However, to take advantage of his absence, the elder princess conspired against the younger princess and ordered her beheading. The king&amp;#39;s wife, on the other hand, became angry with the king and killed him.</content>

<content>Chaolungchu-ka-fa, the history of his successors... In the absence of a worthy successor, the ministers had to administer the affairs of the kingdom. Then, in the family of a Brahmin on the north bank of the Brahmaputra, a young boy named Chu-dang was found whom the Brahmin introduced as his adopted son. Then, the Buragohai became convinced that the young man was the son of the late King Tao-kham-thi and learned that the pregnant young princess had been ordered to be beheaded and that this Brahmin had found her and rescued her Chu-dang-fa, the unborn child of the princess Tao-kham-thi, became king in 1398 AD. When he became king, he summoned the Tipmia chiefs who had conspired against him to a banquet and killed them. He tried to maintain peace with the rest of the Tipmias and married the daughter of a Tipmia chief named Khutai. The king learned that the daughter was in love with a young man named Chulai. She ran away and begged the help of the king of Mu Kong. In the battle, the army of the Ahom Bargohai pursued the enemy to Patkai and finally in 1401 AD a treaty was formally signed demarcating Patkai as the boundary between the two kingdoms. Tai Sulai took refuge with the king of the Komta kingdom and the king of the Komta abandoned the war and married his daughter Bhajani to Chu-Dang-Fa. During his reign, Chu-Dang-fai subjugated the Khamjang and Aitan tribal chiefs who opposed him. In 1407, Chu—–Dang-fa died.

The Ahom army was defeated at Dampuk on the banks of the Dikhou, a treaty was proposed and a princess was sent to the Kachari king. In 1493, Du Hen-fa was killed by men of the Tairungban tribe and succeeded by his son Chu-pim-fa. After the death of this king, his son Chu-hung-mu was crowned on the throne at Chargua in 1497 AD. The growing influence of the Brahmins can be seen from the title he received as Swarga Narayan. He was mainly known as the Dihingia king as he established his capital at Bakta on the Dihingpar and settled many Ahom families around it. In 1504, the Aitnia rebellion was suppressed. In 1510, an investigation was conducted into the number, condition and location of the people of the country and they were divided into several games. In 1512, Habung was annexed to the Ahom kingdom. The glorious achievement of Chu-Hum-Mong was the defeat of the Chutia. In 1513, the Chutia king Dhir Narayan invaded the Ahom kingdom. The Chutia were defeated and forced to retreat. Chu-Hummung conquered the kingdoms around Mu-Khrang and Namdang and established cities there. In 1520, the Chutia again attacked the Ahom fort at Mu-Grang and captured Mu-Grang. Two years later, Chu-Hum-Mu attacked the Chutia army at the mouth of the Checha River and conquered the Chutia kingdom as far as the mouth of the Tikao River. A fort was erected there. In 1523, when the Chutia attacked to besiege the fort, Chu-hung-mu came with a strong army and dealt a severe blow to the Chutia army. 52. Chutia proposed a treaty</content>

The Chutia king refused to obey the order and war broke out again. The Ahom launched a surprise attack on the Chutia army from behind the Choudangiri Hills. The surprised Chutia army fled towards Jun Mukham (Mathadang) and a second attack was launched against them. Their king was hanged. His eldest son was also killed. The Chutia army dispersed and fled and the Ahom army bravely pursued them. All the members of the Chutia royal family except a large number of Chutia soldiers and queens were captured by the Ahom army. The queen committed suicide by being hit by a shell. The entire Chutia kingdom became part of the Ahom kingdom and its rule was entrusted to a newly appointed administrative officer named Shadiakhowa Gohai. The Dihingia king created a new post of Barpatra Gohai to supervise Chenglung, son of the late King Chu-pim-pha, and his queen (whom Chu-pin-phai had deported with a Naga chief for allegedly treating her as an officer while pregnant). He was entrusted with the responsibility of the Barahi, Chutia and Maran who were not in charge The Ahom army attacked and defeated the Muslim army led by the Bazir in 1529 AD, but was defeated again</content>

In 1532, the Muslims led by another general, Turbak, invaded the Ahom kingdom but were defeated by the Ahom army after three years of war. The Ahom army drove the Muslim army to the Karatwa River. @8 In 1539 AD, Chu-Hum-Mu was killed by a Kachari. After his death, Prince Chu-Kleng-Mu was crowned on the throne. During the reign of this king, in 1546 AD, the Konch king Naranarayan invaded the Ahom kingdom. The Ahom army was initially defeated but in the end the Kochas were defeated. In 1552, Chu-Kleng-Mu died. After his death, Siu-kham-pha, known as the Khora king, was crowned on the throne. During his reign, the Konch king Naranarayan again invaded the Ahom kingdom and the Ahom army was defeated in battle. Chu-Kham-Phai was forced to recognize Naranarayan&amp;#39;s sovereignty and transferred parts of the north bank of the Brahmaputra. He died in 1603 AD. After his death, Chu-seng-fai succeeded him as Pratap Singh. The Jaintia king gave his daughter to Pratap Singh on the condition that the bride be taken by the road through Satgaon in the Kachari kingdom. The Kacharis resisted the Ahoms and were defeated by them in battle. The Jaintia princess was brought safely and securely to the Ahom kingdom. The Ahom king sent an army against the Kacharis but the Ahom army was defeated. In 1615, Syed Hakim and Syed Abu Bakr invaded and defeated the Ahom kingdom on the orders of the ruler of Bengal. But later the Mughals suffered a crushing defeat. Conflict with the Mughals resumed and this time the Ahoms attacked and captured Pandu. Lost in the first half</content>

<content>Chaolung du Kapha, the history of his successors... However, in the end the Ahom won the great victory. This incident changed the course of the Ahom military forces and in 1639 a treaty was signed between the Ahom&amp;#39;s uncle Tamuli Barbarua and the Fauzdar Allah-yar-Khan of Guwahati. The treaty defined the boundaries of the Ahom and Mughal kingdoms on the banks of the Barnadi to the north and the Brahmaputra to the south. In 1641, Pratap Singh died. On his death, his eldest son Chu-tit-pha succeeded him as king, but the ministers considered him unworthy and appointed Dyuram-pha&amp;#39;s brother Chu-tin-pha in his place. In 1648, the ministers deposed Chu-tin-phak for health reasons and made his son Chu-ta-mala king. He became king and took the name Jayadeva Singh according to the Hindus. He was the first Ahom king to be converted to Hinduism. The most notable event of his reign was the invasion of Assam by Mir Jumla, ruler of Bengal, on 4 January 1662 AD. The Ahom army refrained from attacking until the Mughal army captured Hajo, Saraighat, Chamdhara on the banks of the Bharlu river and Shimlagarh on the southern bank of the Brahmaputra due to internal conflicts at the top of the Ahom army. It was only on 3 March 1662 that the Ahom navy attacked the Mughal army at Kaliabar and suffered a crushing defeat. Mirjumala captured the capital Garhwal on 17 March 1662 and Jaidhwaj Singh fled to Namrup. However, during the rainy season, the Ahom army began to harass the Mughals from time to time by smuggling, night raids and blocking food supply routes. In the treaty proposal</content>

After his death, King Charing was made king as he was sonless. Chakradhar Singh decided not to submit to the Mughals and decided to declare war against them. Lachit, son of the late Momai Tamuli Barbarua, was appointed commander of the Ahom army. The Ahom army led by Fukan attacked the Mughal camp at Kajli, the capital on the southern bank of the Brahmaputra, and at Banhbari to the north. Several Muslim generals, including Syed Feroze, fell in the battle. In December 1667, the Mughal Emperor of Delhi appointed Raja Ram Singh, son of Mirza Raja Jai Singh of Amber, as commander of an army reinforced by the Bengal army. Ram Singh&amp;#39;s army was well equipped with 18,000 cavalry, 15,000 archers and 30,000 infantry. The Barphukan of Guwahati also made all necessary preparations to confront the Mughals. The plan of defense was prepared in consultation with the three ministers, the Fukans and the Rajkhowas. Ram Singh soon ordered the evacuation of Guwahati and the entire kingdom west of the Barnadi. Barphukan rejected Ram Singh&amp;#39;s demands and advanced towards Agiathuri with his army and ordered Fukan and other officers to attack the enemy. There were several battles and finally the Mughal army was defeated. Ram Singh attacked the Ahom army with his Rajput cavalry and killed 10,000,000 Assamese soldiers in one day.

In March 1675, Debera poisoned the king and killed him. Debera then made a prince of the Chamuguria dynasty named Chu-hong king and killed more than fourteen other princes. Chu-hum, who reigned only eleven days, was killed by Debera Barbarua. In April 1675, Debera made another prince named Gobar king. This prince was brought from the village of Tunkhang.

From 1677 to 1679, a prince of the mountain clan was made king. He became king and took the title of Chu-dai-fa. He is also known as the King of the Mountains. The Barphukan of Guwahati, however, after a disagreement with Buragohain, entered into a secret conspiracy and agreed to hand over the fort of Guwahati to the Mughals if he was made king of Assam. The elder brother of Lachit Barphukan, Laluksola, surrendered Guwahati to the Mughals in March 1679 AD. He then killed the king of the mountains and appointed a prince of the Chamguria clan to rule the country. 58 This prince, known as Lara Raja, took the name Chu-lik-fa according to the Ahom. In practice, the real king Barphukan began to injure the princes of the Tunkhung clan except Gadapani. In 1681, Laluk was assassinated by a young Bhotai, after deposing Chu-lik-phak and deporting him to Namrup. Gadapani ascended the throne in July 1681 and took the name Chu-Patpha according to the Ahom and Gadadhar Singh according to the Hindus. He captured Guwahati from the Mughals</content>

He was not kind to the Vaishnava satras and persecuted the satradhikars of all the satras in order to create difficulties in the governance of the kingdom. He died in February 1696 AD. His eldest son, Lai Gohain, succeeded him as king and took the name of Chu-dhrung-pha according to the Ahoms and Rudrasingh according to the Hindus. He restored the satradhikars and returned their property. Rudra Singh decided to wage war against the Kacharis and sent Ahom troops against the Kachari king Tamradhwaja. Tamradhwaja begged the help of the Jaintia king Ram Singh. However, Ram Singh imprisoned Tamradhwaja in the capital, Jaintiapur. Tamradhwaja sent a guard to Rudrasingh to accept his submission and pray for his rescue. The Ahom king sent an army to attack the Jaintia king but the Jaintia king made no attempt to resist the attack and was captured by the Ahom army. Both the Kachari and Jaintia kings were brought to the Ahom capital of Rangpur. Rudra Singh himself went to Guwahati and formed a large army with the intention of conquering as far as Dhaka in Bengal. He died suddenly in August 1714 in Guwahati.

He handed over the royal umbrella to Queen Phuleshwari to refute the ominous predictions made by Brahmin priests and astrologers. During her (Phuleshwari) reign, the influence of the growing Shakti religion deepened and the Vaishnava satras and Moamara Gosai became disgusted with her for the insults she had inflicted. He accepted Ram Bhattacharya as his religious guru and entrusted him with the supervision of the temple of Goddess Kamakhya on Mount Kamakhya.</content>

<content>History of Chaolung Chu-ka-fa, his successors... King Shiva Singh married a dancing girl named Phulmati of the Nat Koch family of Chinatali. Both the king and queen were greatly influenced by the growing Shakti religion To refute the evil predictions of the Brahmin priests and astrologers, the king handed over the symbol of sovereignty to the Rajasatra Queen and anointed her with the title of &amp;#39;Bara Raja&amp;#39; or chief ruler. During his reign, the Hindu Shakta sect flourished. On the death of Shiva Singh, his younger brother Raja Charing ascended the throne in December 1744 (25 Aghon). He took the name Du-nenpha according to the Ahom and Pramatta Singh according to the Hindu. On his accession to the throne, Pramatta Singh deposed the Kalugaya Barpatra Gohai and Khamcheng Dihingia Bargohai who opposed his coronation. The reign of Pramatta Singh was not eventful. He built brick theaters or open arenas for animal fighting and the paved arches of the fort. He died in 1751 in the month of Ahin. 60 After the death of Pramatta Singh, his next brother, Ramanath Gohain, became king. He took the name of Rajeshwar Singh. In 1758, the Daflas looted neighboring Ghiladhari. Forts were built in the border areas to prevent the Daflas from coming south as a peaceful measure. However, this arrangement did not yield the expected results and an agreement was finally signed to allow the Daflas to forcibly collect money from every household in the border area. King Jai Singh of Manipur appealed to Rajeshwar Singh through the Kachari king Katki to resist the invasion of Burma. The Ahom king agreed to send an army to Manipur to rehabilitate the king of Manipur. The Ahom army suffered many disasters during this journey.

The Assamese army had to fight with great difficulty by destroying forests and cutting down trees. In 1768, another army was sent through the kingdoms of Raha and Kachari with new enthusiasm This time the king of Manipur regained his lost throne and ascended the throne. Jai Singh married his daughter Kuranganayani to Rajeshwar Singh with valuable gifts and a group of Manipuri subjects as dowry. On the death of Rajeshwar Singh, his younger brother, Raja Namrupia, known as Kalshilia Gohain (because he was born in Kalshil camp), succeeded him. When Rajeshwar Singh died, Lakshmi Singh was made king at Rajhauli in Dergaon. Laxmi Singh took the discipleship of his native Shakta Gosai Ramananda Acharya and settled him permanently under the name of Pasmaria Gosai. During the reign of Lakshmi Singh, the Moammar Vaishnavas declared direct rebellion against the Ahom rule. The Moammar Gosai, who was persecuted by Queen Phuleshwari during the reign of Shiva Singh, was again humiliated by Kirti Chandra Barbarua. This incident further expanded the Moammar rebellion. The Maran leaders Ragha and Nahar, disciples of the Moammar Gosai, were beaten by Barbarua. Such incidents fueled the rebellion of the Moammars. When news of the Maran rebellion reached the capital, an army under Tekela Barabez was immediately sent to suppress the rebellion. But the royal army was defeated. A second army was sent under the command of Harnath Bhitarwal Fukan. The Marans, on the other hand, reached an agreement with the exiled princes Mohanmaladeo, Maju Gohain and Saru Gohain. The three exiled princes joined the Moammars on the condition that Mohanmaladeo be made king. The king&amp;#39;s army was defeated, but</content>

<content>Chaolungchu-ka-fa, the history of his successors... The Marans did not install any of the three exiled princes on the throne. They installed their relatives on the throne and imprisoned Lakshmi Singh in the Jaisagar Daul. A few months later, leading figures of both the Ahom and non-Ahom loyalists decided to stage a counter-rebellion to restore the Ahom to power. In 1770, the loyalists of the king, with the help of Queen Kuranganayani of Manipuri, killed the Maran king and his Ragha Barua. The Ahom king Laxmi Singh was released from captivity and other rebels were also captured and killed. New Ahom officers were appointed and thus the Moammar rule ended. Lakshmi Singh died of esophageal disease in December 1780 at the age of On the death of Lakshmi Singh, his eldest son Lok Nath Gohain succeeded him. He became king and took the name of Gaurinath according to the Hindus and Chu-hit-pong-fa according to the Ahom. In April 1783, the Moammars set fire to the Shingrighar of Garhwal and captured the capital, Rangpur. Meanwhile, Rudreswar Barpathra fled to Guwahati and Ghanshyam Buragohain was appointed as the Rajmantri. The Barphukan of Guwahati, however, was able to expel the Moammars from Rangpur. Another serious rebellion of the Moammars began in 1786 on the north bank of the Luit. The Moammars crossed the Brahmaputra and attacked the Garhmur Satra and burnt down its houses and gardens. Several devotees were killed while trying to resist the attack. The remaining troops of the Ahom army on the north bank joined the Ahom army led by Buragohain at Sonari near Rangpur. The Moammars overthrew the weak resistance of the Ahom army and captured Rangpur. The king</content>

The Kachari and Jaintia kings refused to lend a helping hand. But the Manipuri king Jai Singh advanced towards Nagaon with 500 cavalry and 400 infantry and was guided by Gaurinath Singh from Nagaon. The Manipuri army suffered a crushing defeat and had to retreat after suffering heavy losses. Gaurinath Singh fled to Guwahati. The king of Darangi, Krishna Narayan, declared rebellion and conquered a large area of northern Kamrup. “Captain Owais&amp;#39;s Assam Expedition” Helpless, Gaurinath Singh appealed to Lord Cornwallis for military assistance. Despite the clear policy of the British Government not to interfere in the internal affairs of other states, Lord Cornwallis sent six companies of soldiers under Captain Owais to Assam with Lieutenant Robert McProger as Judge and Ensign Wood as supervisor. Dr. J.P. Wadeck was also sent along as an assistant surgeon. Captain Owais&amp;#39; main objective was to expel the Bengal bandits from the Ahom kingdom. On 8 November 1792, Captain Owes arrived in Goalpara. From there he gathered news of the internal situation of the Ahom kingdom. There, King Vishnu Narayan of Darangi met him and gave him a letter sent by Gaurinath Singh, in which Gaurinath compared himself to a ship about to sink under an unbearable burden</content>

Although Captain Owais&amp;#39; main objective was to drive out the bandits brought by Krishna Narayan from Bengal, he had to fight against the Moammars when he reached Guwahati. The captain was also asked to assist the Ahom king in the war against the Moammars. The captain crossed the Brahmaputra to the north bank and defeated Krishna Narayan in battle. He then advanced to Jorhat and defeated the Moammars there. On 18 March 1794, the British soldiers rescued Rangpur and Gaurinath and arrived at Rangpur on 21 March. At the request of Captain Wells, five more companies arrived in Guwahati from Calcutta in late April but had to camp there during the rainy season. Captain Wells left Rangpur on 30 May 1794 and arrived in British territory on 3 July, foiling the last attempt of the Moammars to attack Rangpur. In 1795 (1717) Gaurinath Singh died in Jorhat. He was &amp;quot;a weak, weak man, unable to supervise administrative affairs, always busy with bathing and prayer, often addicted to earrings. The fall of the Ahom kingdom actually began with Gaurinath Singh.&amp;quot; Kamaleshwar Singh alias Cha-Klingpha (1795-1810) After the death of Gaurinath Singh, the cabinet appointed Kinaram, grandson of the Lechai Namrupia king, as king.

The king&amp;#39;s father, Kadam Dighala, was made king of Charing. After the coronation of Kamaleshwar, a significant upheaval began in Kamrup. Haradatta and Biradatta Bujrabarua organized a number of Kachari, Punjabi and Hindustani refugees and declared themselves self-sufficient. Unable to get any support from southern Assam, Kaliabhomora Barphukan formed an army of Hindustani and local troops collected from the kings of Beltala and Dimrua. Baju Singh and Alo Singh Jamadar were appointed commanders. This force defeated the rebels in several battles, Haradatta Biradatta was found and killed. During the reign of Kamaleshwar, a permanent army was formed, abandoning the old policy of recruiting village peasants and using them as soldiers during the war. The combined invasions of the Moammars and Daphlas on the north bank of the Brahmaputra disturbed the peace of the kingdom. Buragohain defeated the rebels with a newly formed permanent army. However, the Moaris and Daflai rebelled again near Baskata on the north bank of the Brahmaputra. A Phopai commander organized the rebel forces. Buragohain himself launched a strong campaign, repulsed the rebels and killed the commander of Phopa. In 1799, the Moammars again declared revolt at Benmara under the leadership of a Bharthi king. Again, the army launched an operation to quell the rebellion and most of the rebel leaders were killed. After this incident, the Ahom administration arrested the Moammar leader Sarbananda</content>

He had no sons and his brother Chandrakanta Singh Chu-din-fa became king. The Rajamantri Purnananda Buragohain was like the guardian of Chandrakant Singh. When he grew up, the king began to despise the Burhagohai. He had a companion named Satram. The king seated him beside the throne. The Da-dangers were displeased with this. The three gentlemen held a special meeting to judge the evil deeds of the satram and exiled him to Namrup. There is no doubt that Badan Barphukan was involved in the attempt to kill Buragohai by the satra. She was the daughter of Badan Barphukan and the daughter-in-law of Burhagohai. There are many ways to get a job in the field of architecture. There are many ways to get a job in the field of architecture. Barfukan reached Calcutta. Later, the king of the Brahmaputra, Badaufaya, became a relative of Badan and stayed in Burma for four months. In late 1816, the Man king sent eight thousand troops with Badan under three generals of Muyang, Man-mau and Mukong. The aim is to destroy Purnananda Buragohain. Badan entered Assam and sent a letter to Swargadeo from Shilikhaguri. But the letter did not reach the king. The Buragohain tore it up. Buragohain sent a group of soldiers to resist the Man army, but was defeated. After receiving this message, Purnananda Buragohain, the guardian of stable Assam, died. His son, Ruchinath Buragohain, became and the army he sent was also defeated. The king Chandrakant Singh asked Ruchinath to take refuge in Guwahati but he refused.

On the death of Badan, Ruchinath summoned Rajeshwar Singh&amp;#39;s great-grandson Brajnath Singh from Bengal to be made king. In February 1818, Ruchinath Buragohain captured Jorhat and installed Brajnath on the throne. He also killed the seal. But he had been mutilated before. So a month later he made his ten-year-old son Purandara Singh king. He was tragically humiliated by the wounding of Chandrakanta Singh and secretly sent messengers to the Man king to inform him. Manja this time in retaliation sent Alang Mingi as his commander with thirty thousand troops against Assam. In February 1819, the Mans entered Assam for the second time. Ruchinath couldn&amp;#39;t do anything to stop him. Ruchinath fled to Guwahati with Purandar Singh. They captured Jorhat and installed Chandrakanta on the throne. The name of the king is Chandrakant Singh, and he conducted all the royal affairs accordingly. Purandara Singh went to Guwahati and gathered troops to drive out the Mans. He sent a group of soldiers but was defeated by the Mans. He then went to Shilmari in the Company&amp;#39;s state of Rangpur and asked for help to expel the Mans but the Company refused. That is, they captured Guwahati. Ruchinath Buragohain fled from Guwahati and entered the Company&amp;#39;s territory and began to gather troops to drive out the Mans. They began to disturb the standard.

After the return of the Mans, Chandrakant Singh came to some knowledge and built a fort and fort to prevent the Mans from coming. There are many examples of these characters in the books of Assam. Mingimaha sent a group of soldiers with Tilwa Baju as their commander. Chandrakant Singh handed over Jorhat to the Rajamantri Kalibar Gohain and went to Guwahati. Mingimaha Tilwa came and entered Jorhat. Caleb was defeated and captured. The Manchu generals invited Chandrakanta to become king, but Chandrakanta Singh Swargadeo did not come and made Yogeshwar Singh, son of Bagakonwar, king of the Ahoms on the 12th of Aghon in He was the brother of Queen Hemo Aideu of Burma. Chandrakant Singh left Guwahati and entered the Company&amp;#39;s kingdom of Bengal. That is, they captured Guwahati. They are the ones who have looted and oppressed Assam. Later, Chandrakant Singh was defeated at the Battle of Mohgarh. Finally, the Manchu Company entered the kingdom of Goalpara and looted a few villages and reached Guwahati. The Man commander summoned Chandrakant Singh and imprisoned him. Later, Mingimaha Bandula returned to Burma. On 17 January 1824, the Manch attacked Bikrampur without declaring war. Later, on 5 March, the East India Company declared war on Burma. The Manchuria army gathered at Kaliabar with the intention of capturing Guwahati. From there he went to Raha.

Finally, after fighting against the Mans and defeating them, the Company accepted the Mans&amp;#39; peace proposal. On February 2, Mane surrendered. Governor-General Lord Amhast declared war on Burma in 1824 and sent the Company&amp;#39;s troops by sea to attack Mandesh, in addition to pursuing the Mans through Assam. Burma lost and proposed a treaty. The Company was formed and the Treaty of Yandabu was signed on 24 February Yogeshwar Singh died in the month of Kati in 1826 at Yogighopa. Chandrakant Singh remained in Guwahati. According to this treaty, Purandara Singh was exempted from paying taxes of Rs. 50,000 per annum. According to the treaty, Puranda became king in the name of Singh. In addition, the Matak and Shadia regions were excluded from the agreement. Puranda Singh, a young man of 25 years, appointed ministers and officers. But the Cabinet was incapable and incompetent. Maniram Dutta was the eternal guardian and treasurer of Puranda Singh. Therefore, it is important to note that the present study is not only a study of the characteristics of the country&amp;#39;s economy, but also of the characteristics of the country&amp;#39;s economy. In mid-1838, Captain Jenkel, who had come to inquire into the kingdom of Purandar Singh, gave a lengthy report against Purandar Singh, and on 16 September 1838, the Ahom kingdom established by Swargadeo Chu-ka-fai was taken away from him.</content>

<content>They succeeded in spreading Hinduism and observing two or four festivals such as Chomdev Puja for a while. The Ahom began to take Hindu gosai as their guru and abandoned the free consumption of alcohol and meat. This change was devastating and the Ahoms gradually deteriorated by eating low-energy foods. 98 Swargadeo built dauls at Ashwaklanta and Dighreshwari and dauls of Rudrapada, Burhamadhava, Purvashankar and Uma. Phuleshwari built the Gauri Sagar Daul, the second princess Draupadi built the Shivsagar Daul and pond and the third princess Sarbeshwari Devi built the Keri Rajmao Daul.

He visited Dakshinpat Satra, Pahumaria Gosai Ghar and Narwa Satra. He also established the satras of Mayamaria. Swargade built a temple of Jayadurga and Harihar at Namti, a copper house, a golden idol and a Shiva temple at Bihali. Gaurinath Singh was succeeded by Kamalesh Singh (g) Klingpha or Chu Hengpha.

Mahamati Purnananda Buragohain dug a pond at Hatigarh in Jorhat and built a Shiva Daul on its banks. He established the Baraengi Satra and became a disciple. Thus the Ahom kings and ministers took refuge in various gosai and embraced Hinduism. As a result, the influence of the Ahom priesthood gradually declined. Even during the coronation, Brahmins were sponsored, but it is actually a Tai Ahom ceremony and only Deodhai, Mohan and Bailung have their own traditional rituals!</content>

They conquered many of the Mataks and became Ahoms. Initially, they belonged to the same Tai ethnic group and took Matak with them whenever they found them. They also included the Barahi as Kathkatiya and Changmai, Randhani Changmai, Jaradhara, Beja, Kukurachowa, Bharali etc. Swargade destroyed the Chutia kingdom and brought a man from there to Chumchiri. Others believe that he belonged to the Deodhai dynasty and went to see the Chutia kingdom early and stayed there for a year. Therefore, only one Ahom was appointed as the guardian of Chomdev. Chukapha brought to Tipam a Matak man named Maimai Three-Urt, a balance-bearer. He made royal robes. Swargadeo Chukhampha made him &amp;#39;Patar&amp;#39; and made him an Ahom.

He gave the king eggplant. In the war against the Nagas, the main man defeated the Nagas and became the favorite of Swargadeo. The first Bargohai, Thaomu Kangan, made him Lanmayu (Eggplant in Ahom) Ahom. There is a Lanmadhu clan among the Chetia. They were the sons of Haldhi Thenga in the days of Pratap Singh and Bandar Barphukan in the days of Lara Raja. Swargadeo Chukapha had a Katki to collect taxes from Komtapur, a Matak Katki to collect taxes from Chutia and a Katki to collect taxes from Kacharis</content>

<content>He employed a Naga Katki to preach Hinduism. A Matak named Mimun wished to pay taxes and live with Swargadeo and made him Ahom. One she made people Ahom by making them Matak leaves. The Mataks were originally Tai (white Tai) people. Therefore, Chukapha knew them as relatives and married them. She lost her identity due to the lack of their own written Tai language and script and in contact with the Kacharis. Swargadeo Sadangphai made seven sons of the Bamun family he had raised princes. The name is Bamuni Konwar. In the days of King Chutthampha, whose princess had no descendants, he brought anyone he found here the next day and gave him a golden sword as a bungalow. Later, during the reign of Pratap Singh Swargadeo, these people gathered the Bamuni princes and held the Konwar Hildari game and named them Giati Konwar. In the reign of Swargadeo Chamuhanpha, Nangchuk Bargohai defeated the Nagas in the battle of Tongchu Naga and brought the Tongchu, Nefera and Maupia tribes and made them Ahoms. In the days of His Majesty Chuhungmung, they subdued the Barbhuiyas and took some of their sons with them as apostles. After the expulsion of the Kacharis from Morangi, the king appointed Lacham of Kalita Bhuyan as the ruler of Morangi (Morangikhowa Gohai) and appointed him as the Banharia Chetia. They were the first to become Ahom. They were the first to become Ahom. They were the first to become Ahom. He is a Miri by race. When Frasengmu Bargohai captured Shadia, the Chutia king&amp;#39;s treasurer gave him a knife and gunpowder. Bargohar kept him in his game and put him in the cocoon. There were two sons of Chutia, Lantimui and Lavithapak. When Tanuram Bargohai married Nanchang girl to Khawa Baja, he gave Langimui Chutia as dowry. His Majesty called him Bhandari Gohain,</content>

<content>He appointed Bhandari Chetia to preach Hinduism. Lathipak remained Bargohai&amp;#39;s horseman. They both became Ahom. His Majesty Chuhungmung appointed a handsome man captured in the battle with the Turks, named Nukturdang, as Katidang Duwara. His Majesty Chuchengpha appointed his granddaughter Tamuli Duwari and later Tamuli. He appointed his son Hildari Barua and settled him in Kaliabar. One of this clan (Langi) was appointed Panisia in Kaliabar. Later, Swargadeo Suchenphai appointed him Barphukan. According to Ahom history, the Langi Kacharis are descendants of prisoners. The Barchiring house from the Nagas gets the name Keyekhun. Therefore, it is important to note that the present study is not limited to the field of physics, but also includes the field of biology, chemistry, and physics.

The Neog Yun dynasty was originally Naga. Pratap Singh&amp;#39;s adopted Naga son Japjal Barchetia. The son of the daughter of the old king Gadadhar Singh, Bejini Kasarrni, was adopted by the king as his grandson. They named the boy&amp;#39;s descendants Budhachetia. They made the Naga boy Lachit the Barua of Chaodang. The Naga boy was named Aogohai and the elephant mouth and horseman were his relatives. He was introduced to the game of horse princes and made a horseman. They took the son of Miri as their son and appointed him as Miri Sandiky. Therefore, it is necessary to take into consideration the following factors: In the days of Prabhap Singh, Laku of Matak was appointed as the chief vessel. The house is known as the Barpatra Gohai of the Matak household. In the days of Swargadeo Rudrasingh, there was a Matak Burhagohai named Chaoflung. Gulibar, son of the Matak king Sarbananda Singh, was appointed Rudhagohai by Chandrakant Singh. This house became known as Buragohai Ghatak. 78.

<content>He preached Hinduism. We have not mentioned the &amp;#39;Chakriphenti Buranji&amp;#39; as an exaggeration. Thus the people were mixed. As a result of this mixture, the Ahom-Tai people came into cultural contact with people of many ethnic groups and immediately adopted the cultural elements of those ethnic groups. In this regard, the mixture of these people had a great influence on religious matters. As the kings and da-dangiyas gradually became attracted to Hinduism and converted to Hinduism and especially Mahapurushia Vaishnavism, the ancient religions of the Ahom, Phuralung and Banphi, lost their predominance and as a result the priestly classes of the Ahom Deodhai, Mohan and Bailung became almost homeless. As in the past, the Ahom could not practice religious life without these Molungs, and instead they were replaced by Gosai-Brahmins and Satradhikars, Gosai-Mahants. As a result, the true religion of the Ahom, Furalung and Ban Phi, began to be neglected. The kings and ministers became more preoccupied with establishing Vaishnava satras and building temples to gods and goddesses and the Ahom temples became neglected. Vaishnavism is not at all conducive to a warrior nation, because Vaishnavism requires the devotee to kneel down and worship. When the prone Pratapi Da-dangiya was obliged to bow before Vaishnava gurus and devotees besides the king, the warrior caste, which had created an aristocracy and was able to keep the pike under its control, brought about the opposite tradition I had to serve. Therefore, the tradition of Vaishnavism weakened the Ahom nation, eventually reaching such a stage that it was seen even among the Ahoms whose heads shook at the sight of human blood. We have discussed this conversion.</content>

<content>The first Ahom king of Assam, Chaolung Chu-ka-fai, brought the Tai language and script spoken among the Mao Sthan (Tai) people of present-day Yunnan Province, China. The Mao Shans, who ruled in Mu-Maolung, the main settlement of the Shan (Tai), included the Tai-dominated areas of present-day southern China, northern Burma (Myanmar) and Thailand. The language of Chu-ka-fa and his followers was the Tai language of the thirteenth century and its script was developed on the basis of the &amp;#39;Mon&amp;#39; script of the Mons (which the Tai considered their own script). The Mon script was based on the Brahmi script of India. It was probably in the 10th century AD that the influence of the Hinyan branch of Buddhism spread to the Mao-Khan region. Earlier, the Mao-Khans were under the influence of the Mahayana branch of Buddhism. Heinous Buddhism as well as the Indian Brahmi script were introduced in these regions. Legend has it that the Tai (Khans) of these regions converted completely to Buddhism (Hinyan) in the late thirteenth century. Therefore, it is not surprising that the Ahom (since they are of the Mao-Khan (Tai) ethnic group) have a very ancient form of the Tai language and Tai script. The Tai language of the Ahoms has not changed much since they came to Assam, where the Tai language was not spoken. Therefore, some of the Assamese words (a small number) used by the writers who adopted the Assamese language (related to Maghadi Prakrit and Sanskrit) as their own language</content>

<content>The Ahom language and script remained almost unchanged except for the incorporation of the Ahom language and script There is absolutely no presence of Assamese script in the Tai-Ahom language. The Ahom script has many characteristics; (1) This script applies only to the Ahom language; It is consistent with one of the Tai-yai scripts. (2) The Ahom script, which is based on the ancient Mon script, cannot effectively reflect some of the phonetic characteristics of the Ahom language. The Ahom language is a tonal language; But its script does not convey that melody. Perhaps later Ahom writers could not preserve them due to lack of necessary knowledge. (3) The present-day Tai-Ahom speakers were not aware of the tones and sounds of the Tai-Ahom language; Only recently has there been an awareness to restore these tones which have become obsolete and lost. The original Tai script is the Ahom characters adopted from the ancient Mon script of what is today called southern Myanmar during the first centuries of the second millennium. The script was brought to the Brahmaputra Valley by the Ahoms in 1228 AD by order of Chaolung Chu-ka-pha. Terwiel suggests that this formula is reasonable on the basis of the following facts. (1) The relationship between the Ahom script and the ancient Burmese inscriptions found at Pagan, dated to the eleventh and twelfth centuries, has been determined by studying the characteristics of numerous similar features found in the form of characters or letters. There are also many similarities between the Ahom script and other scripts of Southeast Asia; However, they are not widely pronounced and the changes observed in the script are often seen in these too and eventually the basis of the Indian script is accepted. (2) Although the Ahom script has good similarities with the Myanmar script, it has nothing to do with the Brahmaputra Valley script since the 5th century AD</content>

<content>The language and script of the Ahom do not match. When the Ahoms entered Assam, there was a division of education in this vast area, especially on the north bank and south. If the Ahoms had not known the technique of writing, they would have adopted the local script; Or they would have invented another script based on it. Therefore, it is quite reasonable to claim that the Ahoms adopted their script in Southeast Asia and that they brought it to their present settlement (Assam). 82 Michael Ferlus has recently expressed doubts about the antiquity of the Ahom script. He concludes that the Ahoms did not bring their script with them in the first half of the thirteenth century; It was only after the Banch settled in Assam that they adopted a script similar to the Prakshan script at some later stage. In order to draw his approximate conclusions, one must fundamentally review the ancient history of the Ahom tribe of the Tai-speaking people. There is a need to re-examine the sources (Terwiel) that cast doubt on the authenticity and reliability of the thirteenth, fourteenth and fifteenth century chapters of Ahom history and conclude that the Tai speakers adopted the script in ancient times. Trerwill examines the issues raised by Falach. One of these issues is related to epigraphy and the other is the so-called lack of consonant clusters. Falas&amp;#39; first argument is that the letters &amp;#39;b&amp;#39; and &amp;#39;d(d)&amp;#39; are juxtaposed with the homonymous letters of the Burmese and Mon languages. According to Falas, the comparative study of the shape of the letters only confirms the Burmese origin of the Ahom script and gives rise to the relative modernity of the Ahom script. Table does not accept this argument.</content>

<content>The Ahom characters are visibly different from the Burmese (Burmese) and Mon characters. Therefore, it is difficult to accept Falach&amp;#39;s argument that the Ahom alphabet is of Burmese origin. The ancient Mon characters adopted by Ferlus to compare with the Ahom characters are not actually ancient Mon characters; This discrepancy led Falace to a wrong conclusion. Therefore, his argument is unacceptable. Falas&amp;#39; second argument was that there was a lack of consonant clusters in the Ahom script. There is no use of consonants in the Ahom language, probably from the strange pronunciation of the Ahom priests when reading the Ahom script. He concluded that the script we accept as ProtoShan did not need to bear the signature of consonants, as there were no consonants in the language it was shaping. It is true that the Ahom priests avoided the use of consonants in writing. For example, when writing the name &amp;#39;Pameplung&amp;#39;, they will write &amp;#39;Pameopung&amp;#39; instead of the consonant &amp;#39;p+n=p&amp;#39; But they teach their children to pronounce the word &amp;#39;pameopung&amp;#39; as &amp;#39;pameglung&amp;#39; They were taught to pronounce it that way by their parents and teachers. This strange rule of pronouncing consonants without writing them is still practiced among the Ahom priests. Priarson was the first to notice this rule. He noticed that r was omitted in words frequently used in written form. Scholars like Table have noted that some priests pronounce some consonants even if they are not in writing. For example, they spontaneously pronounce &amp;#39;j&amp;#39; and &amp;#39;c&amp;#39; even though they have &amp;#39;f&amp;#39; and &amp;#39;k&amp;#39; in the Palbar script.

<content>84 The language and script of the Hams frequently uses the published Ahom-Assamese English Dictionary and this has influenced their pronunciation. This dictionary spells the consonants &amp;#39;khro&amp;#39;, &amp;#39;tro&amp;#39;, &amp;#39;fro&amp;#39;, &amp;#39;klo&amp;#39;, &amp;#39;blo&amp;#39;, &amp;#39;plo&amp;#39; and &amp;#39;nn&amp;#39; in the Ahom language with single consonants. However, this dictionary uses full consonants when writing in Assamese. The Ahom Lexicon published in 1964 simplifies these same Ahom words and spells them without consonants; However, its Assamese and English pronunciations are shown by adding &amp;#39;+r&amp;#39; and &amp;#39;+l&amp;#39; as full consonants. However, Trewill&amp;#39;s argument cannot be accepted either. We have seen in the homes of Ahom priests that their children are taught the Ahom language and the Ahom priests continue to pronounce consonants even if they are written in single characters. This practice is practiced in the homes of most of the Ahom priests. They avoid the use of some consonants in writing but do not do so in pronunciation (ie they pronounce consonants). Furthermore, the consonants found in the manuscripts recovered by this author prove that Falas&amp;#39; second argument is completely incorrect and unacceptable. The texts of this book are explained by J.S. N.S. Fukan and Yehm Buragohain beautifully presented. They have examined many books written in the Ahom language during the time of Chu-ka-pha and earlier in search of these consonants. This author and Professor J.S. N.S. The use of this consonant is found in the manuscripts collected by Fukan and preserved in the Directorate of History and Archaeology, Government of Assam. These books are the oldest books preserved by the Ahom priestly community and on the basis of these the “Ahom Buranji” jbaru “Ahom-Assamese English Dictionary&amp;quot; was prepared</content>

<content>When writing these pages, Baroua simplified all the Ahom words with consonants and wrote them in an unconnected form. Therefore, it can be seen that these basic books used consonants This is evidence of the groundlessness of Falach’s argument. Therefore, such an argument can never be accepted. be All the evidence available so far proves that the Ahom language first took written form in Assam during the reign of Chu-ka-pha. Traville argues that the adoption of the Ahom script proves that scripts have been in use among the Tai-speaking people since ancient times; Not from the thirteenth century as Falace says He believes that the Ahom and ProtoShan scripts developed separately in the thirteenth or fourteenth centuries; and has nothing to do with the Thai script discovered in 1283 AD. This &amp;#39;Thai&amp;#39; script has helped to develop a separate Thai alphabet. Travel examined all possible historical evidence, legends, social customs, etc. of the preparing period. He noticed that the characters of the ancient Mon script used in the eleventh-century pagan writings were different from the characters of the four separate Mon scripts shown in Tha Myatt&amp;#39;s table. There is a clear connection between the Ahom script and the ancient Mon script used on the tablets engraved with the Buddha statues published and printed in Old Burma - Early Pagan. No other language in Southeast Asia has so many similarities to the Ahom script. These similarities are not only noticeable in the size or form of the characters, but also in the space between words and the diacritics that distinguish between sounds. In the 12th century, the script was adopted by the Mon language from southern India via South Syam. The script was also used in Pali fruits. Burmese for the first time in the 12th century</content>

<content>86 THE LANGUAGE AND SCRIPTURE OF THE HOMS (Burmese) The characters of this script were chosen when the language appeared in written form. (Terwiel) After carefully examining the Pagan scripts, Terwiel concluded that the ancient Mon script was the ancestor of the Ahom script. The idea that the Ahom script originated from the Mon script is not new. Scholars like Ranoo Wichasin accepted this view. There are many similarities between the ancient Mon script and the Ahom script used in southern Burma in the 12th century. It is more closely related to the Ahom script than any other 12th century script known to date. (Terwiel) History records that Chaolung Chu-ka-fai communicated with his Nichao (mother&amp;#39;s brother) son by writing letters in Tai language (script). If the Ahoms had not brought with them the script of Southeast Asia, it would have been natural for them to adopt the same script prevalent in the Brahmaputra Valley. Mastering these scripts was no more complicated than the ancient Mon script; and the Ahom language is equally difficult to carry melodic and semantic characteristics. In the sixteenth and seventeenth centuries, the Assamese script began to compete with the Ahom script and the oldest Ahom coins are found in Assamese characters. The Ahom language and script have been used on coins since 1663 AD. The oldest Ahom inscription to date is found in the Sarpastast inscribed with the name of Chu-Hong-Mung. This king reigned from 1497 to 1539 AD. In addition to these stone tablets, coins, legal agreements written on copper plates and numerous inscriptions on inscriptions indicate the widespread use of the Ahom script. The Ahom script came with Chu-ka-pha in the early thirteenth century, as evidenced by the prevalence of books containing chicken tail examination and auspiciousness. com</content>

<content>Nowhere in these manuscripts is there a single word borrowed from Assamese or other Buddhist literature. These are books written entirely in the Ahom language. This proves that the Ahom priests were involved in reading these books written in the Ahom language and prophesying. It must also be said that this kind of knowledge cannot be acquired with just a few years of experience. Since the practice of divination by looking at the tail of a chicken had been in vogue since the days of Chu-ka-pha, books on the subject were in circulation in the Ahom language (script) during the reign of Chu-ka-pha. In his research into the source of the Ahom script, Wilaiwan Khanittanan expressed doubts about the Tai script brought by the Chao-lung-cha-ka-kai. He comments that the Bhai script was invented 500 years (after the arrival of Chu-ka-pha in Assam) or later. He also says that the Ahoms never identified themselves as &amp;#39;Ahoms&amp;#39;; In Ahom history, they refer to themselves as &amp;#39;Tai&amp;#39; or &amp;#39;Tai-Raw&amp;#39; This doubt remains among research scholars because they have not studied all the books in the Tai language in Assam. The name &amp;#39;Ahom&amp;#39; was given to the Tai people who came with Chu-ka-ka by the local inhabitants of the Indo-Mongolian branch, such as the Borovari Barahi, Maran and Kachari. The word &amp;#39;Ahom&amp;#39; is derived from the word &amp;#39;Assam&amp;#39; or &amp;#39;Assam&amp;#39; used to refer to the newly arrived Shyams or Shans. As mentioned earlier, Ahom words are not as simple as people think. The use of consonants such as cla, fan, flak, the absence of borrowed words in the Ban-cheng (Malag-chowa) books, and the use of archaic words with the same or similar meanings as shown by Fukan and Reham Buragohar clearly prove that most of these researchers&amp;#39; assumptions are incorrect.

<content>The language and script of the Ahoms is found in the following quotation. Alas! The Ahom language has lost its melodic characteristics due to lack of discussion. Otherwise, these doubts would not have occurred to scholars. 88 Some scholars believe that the restructuring of the Ahom language is most likely to succeed if the leaders of the Ahom language restoration movement adopt one of the existing Tai languages as the basis. They believe that it would not be correct to consider Thai, Khamati, Fake, Khamyang and Aiton languages as the main carriers of Ahom words and ideas. These are all distinct Tai languages and each has its own tone characteristics and pronunciation. A Tai language, which is prevalent in this region (in its living form) and has the most characteristics in common with the Ahom language, must be adopted for this purpose. According to these scholars, and many others, the Ayton language should be considered as the closest living language to the ancient Ahom language. The Ahom people could adopt the melodic characteristics of the Aiton language to express the melodic sounds of the Ahom words and establish the Ahom language as a melodic language Therefore, it is necessary to take appropriate steps in this regard. They should decide to revive the Ahom language by adopting certain melodic sounds. If the Aiton language is taken as a model, then the tone characteristics of the Aiton language must also be taken and the basic grammatical rules of the Ahom language must be determined. Computer-assisted linguistic tone system - ie every Ahom word or sentence requires a long time to be pronounced, recorded and preserved in legal tone and properly disseminated. In addition, teachers of this language must first be trained in pronunciation and tone characteristics. When Ahom scholars translate an Assamese sentence into Ahom, the Ahom synonyms of every Assamese word are in the Tai-Ahom script</content>

<content>The method of converting the language and script of the Ahom into symbols will not preserve the syntax of the original Ahom language; Instead, an artificial language will be created. The Ahom people would benefit from establishing the Ahom words and phrases found in reliable Ahom sources on the basis of the pronunciation rules of the law language. Now it is necessary to discuss some things about the &amp;#39;type&amp;#39; or size and font of the printing press of the Ahom language. The Ahom-Assamese English Dictionary, published by the Baptist Mission Press in Calcutta in 1920, was the first printed script in the Ahom language. The Ahom Buranji (1930) and The Ahom Primer (1936) and The Ahom Lexicon (1964) also use the same printed script. In 1987, a new font was introduced for the publication of the Assamese Engish-Tai Dictionary and it is much different from the font used in the 1920s. In 1992, Trewill and Ranu invented a new type. Stephen More came up with another type of type. The Eastern Tai Sahitya Sabha has a heavy responsibility in this regard. They should develop a font based on the letters and words used in the unpublished books in handwriting. This will open a new path for the Ahom language and script. So this should be done as soon as possible. Context Notes : (1) This scholar, B. J. Trawill, has given extensive discussion of the Ahoms in two books, &amp;#39;The Tai of Assam&amp;#39; (2) Dr. J. N. Fukan in his article &amp;#39;Ahom Script in the Thirteenth Century&amp;#39; comments on the Ahom script and gives specific examples of consonant consonants to prove the fact that the Ahom script was brought by Chu-ka-kai in the early thirteenth century.</content>

<content>The Ahom Language and Script (3) Article by BJ Terwiel. It should be noted. Researchers Alfons Weidert and Stephen Morey of the University of Heidelberg studied the reconstruction of the tone system of the Ahom language. They comment that the linguistic classification of Ahom within the northwestern dialect group of Tai languages (which includes Khamti and Shan) is modern in converting the vowels at the beginning of words in pro-Tai languages to non-vowels or non-vowels Based on the tendencies of the Tai languages. Like Khamti and Shan, Khun, Tai Yuan and Tailu, which Egerod classified between the Shan and Siamese language groups in 1959, have a tendency to convert the original vowels to non-vowels. On the other hand, the Ahom language converts the vowels of the original Pro-Tai language (like Siamese) to nasal consonants, as seen in Khamti and Shan. He thinks that the differences between Ahom, Khamti and Shan on the one hand, and Siamese and their dialects on the other, are not so important as to justify dividing the Tai languages into separate subgroups. It is also argued that the etymological identification of the written form of the Siamese language with the vocabulary of the Ahom language is based on the phonetic similarity of the words Therefore, hundreds of Ahom words can be limited to three phonetic characteristics *A, *B, *C, with the help of the two phonetic symbols shown in the Siamese script. (Journal of the German Orinted Academy 1979) In this way, linguists can carry out the process of reconstruction of the tone characteristic system of the Ahom language. However, in doing so, the law and the tone characteristics of the language must also be considered.</content>

<content>Chapter VI The Priestly Class of the Ahom Scholars generally say that when Chao Lung accompanied Sukapha to Myut Dun Chun Kham (modern Assam), he accompanied Masam and Masaik and that the priests of the Bailung dynasty were already in this section. The book says: &amp;#39;Landon, Thenkham, Laugri, Jachingpha, Chaopha Tai discussed with Khulung Khun Lai and explained to them about various rituals for the welfare of the country when he descended to Myungri-Myungram. This is how the worship was conducted for the welfare of the country. Chaolung Sukapha could not stay in the Myungmao kingdom and went down to Myung-dun-sun Kham with the god Chumseng. While in Deutsche (Charaideo), the king let the chicken farmers Mosam and Pangpata Mosai do the me myung. He put horses from the north to the south. They worshiped the gods and goddesses with other animals and objects and made Me-myung-me-ban (Me-dam-me-phi). When the country was rained with lightning, the heavenly gods allowed the gods to make a debt. worshiped Song Myung in the month of Dim (third).&amp;#39; Thus, Chao Lung Chukapha came to this kingdom and started the tradition of worship. - Page 277 says &amp;#39;Mahung Luk Man Song Pi Nong Cham Le Nangman Chao Khunglung Chu Man Tao Mon Lai Seng&amp;#39;, meaning two brothers, sons of Mahut Pandit.

Later, the Khanamukhia Mohan descendants had to be initiated into different religions in different places. Some of them went into Mayamara. Debera Chatai Fukan had seven sons and a daughter named Sengdai. This sengdai is very charming in appearance and quality. The king of Gobar wanted to marry her, but the king told her that he could not marry her in the gurugrah. The king of Gobar cursed her that she would die at home without getting married.

<content>The Ahom priestly class 111 Thao-lung-ngam, son of Fasang-din-khun Zhiu, married at a time when there were no proper rules and regulations for marriage. His sons were a good man named Newber and a great scholar and religious leader named Pu-hai Pa-fi-chu. Pu-phi-chu had 800,000 disciples and the &amp;#39;Fura&amp;#39; of heaven was the royal priest of the Myung-phi kingdom of Landon. He disappeared and went to earth earlier, and Fa-Barut was made his master. The son of Pa-ki-chu was Moplong, or Bailung Pandit. This great teacher was a disciple of I-Sangching of the Mahupta dynasty It is noteworthy that I-Sang-Sing&amp;#39;s son Pu-Zak-ji was a high-ranking expert and scholar and religious teacher and was a contemporary of Moplong. They both received knowledge from Ai-Sa-Ching of the Mahung dynasty. It was Aisang-Sing who wrote the main religious book of the Tai-Ahom, “Pak Pen Ka Ka”. When he began this work, he offered tarpan to three great teachers, Pa-phi-chu, Fu-chitkhring and Hun-kham-5m, ie Jahingpha. Therefore, when Jasingpha is worshipped, three pubs are given in a funte (mehenga). This great teacher Mopnang was the ancestor of the Bailung dynasty. It is true that the original man of Bailung Pandit entered the land called Baichali, which Tukapha called Mu Dun Chun Kham, before the arrival of Sukapha and met His Majesty Lukapha in this land. The people referred to as &amp;#39;lost&amp;#39; in the history written in Assamese were some of the people who came on the Tai expedition in the beginning. These were the people she left to collect &amp;#39;sut&amp;#39; or taxes from the defeated Chutia, Manipur and Garo kingdoms on behalf of the kingdom. His Majesty Bukapha knew that these people were Tai who had come from earlier, so he spoke to them in the Tai language and welcomed them into his people. Among them was the original man of Bailung.

<content>112 The priestly class of the Ahom speaks of 21 generations, and the Deo Dhai and Mohan speak of 14 generations. Thaomung Mocham of the Laokhri-Sangbun dynasty came with Sukapha. One of his sons, Baoleng Deka, was sent by the king to visit the Chutia Tiura (Chutia) village. They found a man with a mother and daughter and stayed there When the year passed, the king thought that he and his men had been captured by the Chutia and sent them to kill the Chutia village. The king&amp;#39;s men found them and brought them back. &amp;quot;If their wives feed, clothe and dress their men, they should take the chang house. Their goddess is a female. I could not leave the village because I climbed the chang to find out about it,&amp;quot; he said. The king liked it and established Chumchiring in the Dhopabar area of Charideo. They gave him a house and a garden. Mosam&amp;#39;s grandson Lanma was about 40 years old when he lost the first Buragohain, Thaoruru Buragohain. The son of the younger Gohain of Lanmai, became the Burha Gohain. Therefore, the Buragohai and the Deodha do not marry considering them as brothers and sisters. Moreover, both families are descended from the same ancestor. Later, he was appointed Burhagohai from that clan during the reign of Rajeshwar Singh. Chukapha came to Assam with Kaseng Dam and Senkalu of Khao Mu Khuttal. Both were scholars of theology and when kings, subjects and soldiers fell ill, they were given ban-seng and took news of the good and bad of the country from them. They were also given responsibility for the worship of the gods. They were of the Mahung clan. When Glucapha came to Assam, he left Kasengdam in the Man country and took Chenkaluk to Muo-don-chun-kham. Chenkaluk died in Charideo. He had five sons. (1) Maicheu (2) Maraona (p) Tangmuchao (4) Lachit and (5) Lepete. • The Mahads wrote books such as Sachipatiya Mantra Puthi and Buranji in Bhai language.

<content>The Ahom priestly class is their distinctive feature. There are seven clans of the Mahungs. The Mahungs in Khanamukh were forced to flee to various places during the Manch invasion. Many Khanamukhia Mahals are initiated into different religions in different places. Some of the Khanamukhi Mahans became servants of Aniruddhadeva and became Mataks. They have not given up their ancestry even though they have been initiated into different sects of Hinduism and Vaishnavism and lived in different places. It is said that in the eighth generation of Maomung Mosam, a priest named Thaoshenken went across the Dihing in search of bulls for Umpha Puja. The sons of the household who adopted the Bamuni prince of Habung were made princes by the Bamuni prince Chudangphai and kept them as princes. They settled in the Bamun village of Molung Habung. These houses are called Gharphalias or Fik Chai because they are split from the clan. Later, the influence of Bamuni Hinduism increased and there was a religious conflict between the Bamuns and the Molungs in Habung. Finally, the Molungs moved away to the south. Therefore, they ridiculed Molung as a great scholar. The Molungs merged with some Missing communities and remained Deodhai Missing. 113 His Majesty Chuhungmung divided everyone into clans. Therefore, it is important to note that the Ahom tribes were not included in the seven-house Ahom dynasty. They begin to live like she is a human being. However, the Tai language was needed to facilitate communication with the eastern kingdoms, so some Molung boys were sent to Naradesh Mukong to learn the Tai language. The Molungs worked for the development of the Tai language and communicated with the Nara people in Naradesh through Tai language education. Some Molungs leave their jobs as priests and astrologers to learn technical skills and do various jobs. They were captured by the Kochs and settled in Barpeta, Kamrup.

<content>The priestly class of the Ahom became the household Bamuns who went to war. During the reign of King Khora, the Molung boys who went with the Nara princess to learn the language returned from Naradesh. There are many different types of bailung, ripe bailung, etc. Due to the long gap, Nara Bailung&amp;#39;s household is married to other Bailung. Masai Deodhai was a royal astrologer at all times from the days of Pratap Singh to the days of Chakradhar Singh. There was also a Mosai Fukan in Mohan&amp;#39;s house. There are many ways in which you can improve your self-confidence. There are many ways in which you can improve your self-confidence. Later, Banlung&amp;#39;s eldest son, Madam Bandhai, became a Baroua. The youngest son is Lacham Hatibarua of the time of Jaidhwaj Singh. Jayadeva Singh&amp;#39;s radical Hinduism disturbed the Molungs. The Muslims (Mughals) took over Assam and the king became a fugitive king. The Malungs were forced to hide when they heard that Jaidhwaj Singh was planning to become king again and force them to rebel against the kingdom. Later, the king understood everything and called the Malungs. A man named Pamandam worshiped and brought rain when there was a drought in the country. The king did as he had said and held the Umpha worship. Later, the country became independent by the Malungs following the previous policy of the Ahoms – the Ahoms defeated the Mughals at Sarai Ghat. 114 In the days of Gadadhar Singh Swargadeo, Lomai Padan Bardeodhai became a Barua. He was a talkative and thoughtful man. Swargade diluted the worship in the Ahom manner and knew how to perform the traditional Ahom worship in the same manner. Gadadhar Singh, who believed in tradition, paid great attention to the Molungs. However, during the reign of his son Rudra Singh, the king took refuge in the Bengali gosai and abandoned the Ahom tradition. During the reign of this king, who believed in Hindu tradition, the Ahom lost their position in the caste ladder. The Molungs lost their importance. Pramatta Singh Swargadeo</content>

<content>The Ahom priesthood cut off the noses and ears of some of the Molungs in 115 days, considering them anti-Hindu. During the reign of Rudra Singh, young men interested in Hinduism were sent to Navadwip, Kanauj and Kashi to study Bamunia. They were accompanied by Bailung Barua, the youngest son of Lemai Deodhai, who became the litikai of the Bamuns. He lived abroad for a while in Kamakhya, Bhairav, etc. and later came to Rangpur and became a Bamun. Some of them became Bairagi Barua. Satram and Krishna Krishna Bailung, childhood friends of King Chandrakant Singh, were of the fifth generation. With the royal favor, Krishna later became Krishnaram Bharali Barua. As a devotee of Krishna, he was known as Krishnadam - Bailung by caste. They belong to the priestly class of the Ahom. During the burning of history by Kirti Chandra Barbarua during the reign of Swargadeo Rajeshwar Singh, Chaoseng Sengdhawa Barbarua fled to the mountains with his books. He hanged his two younger brothers on the stake. Another Molung tribe member was killed by cooking oil. Some were released with their noses and ears cut off. The youngest son of Maubi (or cake eater) of Barbarua&amp;#39;s gosai, Laipat (Lerela), died in the battle of Matak. Mouby ate sweets and got rid of the crime of hiding the book. Purnananda Buragohain was a powerful minister during the reign of Swargadeo Gaurinath Singh. They began to despise the Ahom, especially the Molungs, who followed the traditional Hindu religion. Therefore, it is important to understand the importance of the Ahom customs and traditions. Therefore, it is important to understand the importance of the Ahom customs and traditions. They captured and cut off their companions. Most of them are from the homes of the Sam Molungs. Then Lema cut off all the sons and grandsons of Hakra (Shukura) in the house. When the old man died, the family built a large grave and dug a pond nearby as a sign. There is still a snowstorm at Nahartali Deodhai Chowk. One of the Molung Nagas fled to the mountains. They are still Nagas.</content>

<content>116 The Priestly Class of the Ahom For these reasons many Sam-Momungs became surrenderers. They lived in different places at different times and were transformed into other tribes with different titles. There are many people who have been tied up in Chabua in Dibrugarh district. The Bailung Bairagi Barua house became a Bamun altogether. The Gharphalia Deodhai and Bandhai Barua now belonged to the Matak caste. **** : 1) Ahom Buranji (edited by Raisahab Golapchandra Barua 1930) 2) Deodhai Assam Buranji-Sri Surya Kumar Bhuyan (edited) 1990 Documentary History of the Ahom (Translated, edited and annotated - JN Phukan, Romesh Buragohain, Ye Hom Buragohain) 10, 277, 1960 BK Gohain Collected Books 4) Raj Buranji - - 5) Raj Buranji - 2 6) Deodhai Mohan Bailung Genealogy</content>

<content>120 Biography of the Ahom Priestly Scholars During the British rule, PR Gordon, Sir Edward Gate, Delton, Mackenzie, etc. sent men to the Ahom scholarly areas of Shivsagar to collect historical books in the Ahom language. These Ahom language books were collected and translated into English with the help of five Ahom language scholars from Maranjan, Jajli and other areas of Patsanko. These five scholars were assisted in this translation. The scholars who assisted in this translation were Yajnaram Barua (Akhaiya village), Pancharam Deodhai Fukan (Akhaiya Deodhai village), Lopeswar Barua Hatibarua (Hati Barua village), Bengali Mohari Deodhai Fukan (Jajli village), Gadai Bastahiya Barua (Maranjan). There are many different types of characters in the film, but the most important one is the character of the heroine. Pancharam Akhaiya Deodhai Fukan was the son of Daga Fukan. Daga Fukan was the son of Rajpandit Khao-Tek-Fukan (or Akhaiya Fukan) during the reign of Chaopha Chu-pat Fa (Gadadhar Singh) Swargadeo (1681-96). According to the Ahom tradition, the house of the royal scholar wrote books in the Tai language, studied the old books and arranged for their rewriting. This Pancharam Fukan translated the book under the supervision of Edward Gate. This Pancharam Fukan&amp;#39;s son Nandaram Deodhai Fukan was also a scholar. He taught Pandit Pravar Dr. Surya Kumar Bhuyan the Tai language. T° Bhuyan considered Deodhai Fukan as a friend. The victim was identified as 20-year-old Arun Kumar, a resident of Jajli Maniki village in Mahmara Mouza. He was a Tai Pandit of the Mohan dynasty. His Tai language is extensive</content>

<content>The Ahom priestly class had knowledge and in addition to their knowledge of history, they had immense knowledge of Tai culture. The Bengali Mohari Deodhai Fukan belonged to the Pet-Tai clan of the Deokhai clan. The victim was identified as 20-year-old Arun Kumar. He had a proper knowledge of the Tai language. She inherited the knowledge of watching the Mars of language, conducting puja services from a family of scholars.

<content>The Ahom priestly class was encouraged by his father Damchao Gangaram Fukan and mother Dam-lang Chadai Rajkumari Fukan. He is also a great scholar of the lineage of the famous Tai scholar Khao-Tek Mo Fukan, a descendant of Khaotek Mo Fukan of the same lineage. 125 Khao-tek Mo-fun was the royal scholar of the Deodhai dynasty in the days of Chao-fa-chupapha (Gadadhar Singh). The three priestly scholars, Mohan and Deodhai Bailung, were identified in Tai as Cham-m-myung (Cham-tini, m-pandit, myung-desh), meaning the three royal scholars of the country. These three scholars were often referred to as &amp;#39;Chao-m&amp;#39; (Chao heavenly, m-holy), Mo-cham (mo-scholar, Cham-tini, as well as Mahung-changbun-malong to refer to these three scholars Therefore, it is important to note that the present study is not only a study of the characteristics of the country but also of the characteristics of the country&amp;#39;s history In addition to writing history, the Tai scholars continued to practice astrology, diagnosis of diseases, writing books, preserving books, and literature until the Ahom kings came into partial contact with Hinduism towards the end of their hundreds of years of rule They were very loyal to the Swargadeus in conducting their affairs and social activities, but they could not abandon the advice of the Bhai Pandits during the British era</content>

<content>These three scholarly classes continued to practice the Tai language and culture on their own, despite the fact that the rest of the Ahom priestly class also introduced the Hindu religious process as a whole. Therefore, it is important to understand the importance of these languages and cultures in the development of Assam. Therefore, it is important to understand the importance of these languages and cultures in the development of Assam. As an inheritor of a rich tradition, Molung Damchao Damburu Deodhai Fukan also received his first lessons in the Tai language at home from an early age. She was encouraged by her father Damchao Gangaram Fukan and mother Dam Lang Chadai Rajkumari Fukan and at the &amp;#39;Tol&amp;#39;-like Tai language center run by her grandfather Damchao Saru Nath Fukan. In addition, he learned all aspects of the Tai language, Tai religious traditions, Tai songs, mantras, etc. from Damchao Nandanath Fukan, the famous Tai scholar and author of the Ahom Lexicon. The late Fukan, who had just entered high school in regular modern education, became a scholar of the Tai language in a very short period of time due to his brilliance. His father, Gangaram Fukan, worked as a clerk in the Lakua Naharhabi plantation of the British Company at the time and was also a very intelligent man. Mr. Chamchao Fukan&amp;#39;s eldest brother, Mr. Damchao Keshav Fukan, was also a very gifted person by inheritance who passed the entrance examination from the University of Calcutta with first division with letter at that time. Damchao Dambar Deodhai Fukan would go back to Guwahati in 1945 to work as a translator of Tai language books, which his brother Damchao Nandanath Fukan had left to do in the History and Archeology Department of the Government of Assam</content>

<content>The Ahom priesthood was needed. She regularly translated many books in the language with Dr. Surya Kumar Bhuyan as her director. After working in the department for about five years, he returned home and continued to establish Tai language schools and train Tai traditions in rural areas. In 1962, three Pandits played a special role in forming the All Assam Mohan Deodhai Bailung Sammelan to preserve the heritage of the Mohan Deodhai-Bailungs. In 1975, he pioneered the establishment of the Sadao Assam Furalung Sangha to preserve the religious traditions of the Tai Ahom. The Central Tai Academy was established in 1964 at Pat Sankot through the sole efforts of Damchao Fukan to teach the Tai language regularly. He then led an eighteen-member delegation from Assam to the International Tai Study Seminar in New Delhi in The Purbanchal Tai Sahitya Sabha was formed in 1981 to fill the need for an institution for the study of the Tai language in Delhi. The entire Tai Ahom people appointed Damchao Fukan as the founding president of the Eastern Tai Sahitya Sabha and Dr. Pushpa Gogoi as the secretary. In 1984, he was invited to the International Tai Studies Seminar in Bangkok, Thailand, where he was awarded the title of Chief Molung for his growing knowledge of Tai language and culture and Tai religious traditions. During his lifetime, he initiated thousands of people on both the north and south banks of the Brahmaputra into the Furalung sect as a religious mass. He played the role of the chief Molung several times in the Om-Fa Puja held in the courtyard of Amlakhi Deoshal. He attended several Buddhist conferences held in Delhi and Varanasi.

<content>He wrote many research articles on the priestly culture of the Ahom. In short, Mr. Damchao Fukan had become an institution. He passed away on 15 February 1993 at the venue of the Langeri session of the Eastern Tai Sahitya Sabha. 128 Ti-phi-chat Several temples (Tiphi-chang) were established during the reign of the Ahom kings. The Shadia Deoshal, Charideo Shal and Amlakhi Rangagara Deoshal were centrally established. There are also Hatibarua Deoshal between Hatibarua Deodhai village and Akhaiya Deodhai village, Bahguri Deoshal in Barchahki Mohan Deodhai area, and Bardeodhai Bailung Gaon Deoshal, Bairagib Deoshal, Bardeodhai Deoshal (in Bakta Mouza) in Bar Deodhai village area. was established. Such temples were also established in Ramu Deodhai village and Charing Deodhai village in Shimluguri. The Hatibarua Deoshal in Khalai Ghogura Mouza has been obsolete for several years. There is also a central Umpha Puja held every twelve years at the central Amlakhi Rangagara Shalkhani. In 1962, a group of priests was formed to discover the truth of the Tai Ahom texts written in the past and to follow their traditions through reflection and research. Several groups have been formed for the same purpose. The Ahom priesthood did not convert to Hinduism and continued to follow the old Ahom customs. Later, however, these three priests, Faidmahan, Deodhai and Bailung, gradually became influenced by Hinduism</content>

<content>They are seen from the priestly class of the Ahom. There is some mention of this in the book of Indira Barua. Furthermore, from personal experience we have seen that such social changes began to take place among them for various reasons. However, it is noteworthy that today only the Mohan Deodhai and Bailung people practice the original religion of the Ahom. The Mohan-Deodhai-Bailuo Sammelan, formed in 1962, has been working to spread the true Ahom religion everywhere and to encourage the entire Ahom nation to follow the true religion by writing the necessary rules and regulations to follow the customs of the old Ahom religion. From personal experience, despite the natural changes, the Mohans, Deodhais and Bailungs do not want to consider themselves Hindus. The Ahom people today understand the significance of the original Ahom religion and the importance of following their own religion. There is an increasing tendency among the ordinary Ahom community to follow their traditional religion despite being in the midst of Hinduism. Therefore, the Ahom religion has been performing various pujas at home according to the customs and rituals prescribed by the Mohandeodhai-Bailung Sammelan. In the past, the Mohan, Deodhai and Bailungs played a special role during the reign of the Ahom kings. Therefore, it is important to note that the present study is not a comprehensive study of the history of the country. They had to attend the royal assembly and give their opinions and advise the king as well as the king on important matters. Their views were always taken seriously in the royal council. In addition to the kings, Ahom scholars were employed to write the histories and genealogies of the Burhagohais and Bargohais. The scholars of these three dynasties practiced history, astrology and literature for generations. Looking at Mars in the royal court ●</content>

<content>The presence of Ahom scholars was important in the advice given by the Ahom priestly class and in determining the auspicious moments. They had a reputation for giving correct, impartial and honest advice. 130 The scholars of the three dynasties were responsible for writing the royal history under the supervision of Chiring Fukan. They were also responsible for teaching history and politics to the children of princes and nobles. When a king died, the Deodhai Pandits played a special role in installing a new one on the throne. Before the new Swargadeo was crowned, the Deodhai Pandit was given the responsibility of removing the previous Jana&amp;#39;s Dam from the throne. The Deodhai Pandit installed Bandhai Barua on the throne and made him a Deo. Therefore, it is important to understand the importance of these characteristics. There are many characteristics of these characters. The new king asks for royal enjoyment from the man who rose with the queen and then bids farewell to the man&amp;#39;s body and the deodhai gives two golden and silver bowls to the Pandit and takes his blessings They are also responsible for the burial of the deceased in Charideo. They are also responsible for the burial of the deceased in Charideo All the royal auspicious religious ceremonies, including ancestor worship, were performed on them and they had to go to war even during the war.</content>

<content>The Ahom priestly class, however, is not an Ahom word. It is a public place of worship built to establish and worship the main gods and goddesses of the tribal people. The Ahom king Chukapha was married to the Maran king Badoucha and the Barahi king Thakumtha and asked them: &amp;quot;Then the king said, &amp;#39;Where is the best place for us to stay?&amp;#39; They stayed on the small mountain in the north.” 131 This small hill is called Charideo and there was the temple of the Barahis This is where Glukapha held an auspicious ceremony and ascended the throne. In the Ahom Buranji, Chukapha established a town at Charideo on the slope of a small hill at Lakni Muken and sacrificed one horse to the north and another to the south. He offered a vessel filled with silver, worshiped the three local gods of the earth named Kamle, Rangle and Rangmalao and cleaned the place and placed the vessel at the root of the tree. It is said that the Ahom gods were worshiped here. This was probably the first temple establishment festival of the Ahoms and the Charideo temple was the first royal temple. There he placed the god Lankuri. There are many different types of characters in the film. There are many different types of characters in the film. The public temple for the da-dangiyas, officers and subjects was located at Lanka near Garhwal. Lanka is located in the area between the Dichang River to the north and the Dikhou River to the south. The river Darika flows through it. The Burhagohani Paria became a permanent residence in Lanka from the reign of Chu Pim-Fa Swargadeo (1493-1497). The Prime Minister of His Majesty Dyupim-Fa was Khung-Sung-Kham Buragohain.</content>

<content>He was a member of the Ahom priesthood and lived in Lanka. The descendants of Chao Churang Qinglung, the son of a Buragohai, and La-jan, the sixth of his fourteen sons, belong to the Langkia Buragohai clan. 132 This Lanka recovered a temple at the mouth of the Jamuna and on 31 January 1990 held the Me-Dam-Me-Fi ceremony on a regional basis. The temple is located under a large bamboo tree. The temple was previously established under the patronage of Burha Gohai and Da-Dangria. The locals have been looking at and obeying this awakened temple with great respect. Towards the end of the Ahom Empire, the temple of Charideo was shifted to Amlakhi Rangagara in Lakua. The temple was run by the king&amp;#39;s gashikala khat. Achievements of the Department of History and Archeology The Department of History and Archeology was established since the days of discovery and preservation of historical and archaeological resources initiated by Major General Francis Jennis; The British Government&amp;#39;s sincere efforts and research in search of history and ethnology of the various ethnic groups living in Assam led to the promising efforts of JR Cunningham, then Director of Education, Assam. Mr. Cunningham was repeatedly informed of the difficulties he faced in Assam due to the absence of any research center or university due to his stay in other provinces as a result of various applications and communications made by him, both officially and privately, during his tenure as Director of Education (1912-31).</content>

<content>In January 1928, the Ahom priesthood sent a proposal to the Local Government to open a Department of History and Archaeology. As a result, His Excellency the Governor Sir Laurie Lucas Heman established the Department in June 1928 and on 25 June 1928 issued a notice to all Government Departments, Commissioners, Heads of Departments, Commissioners and Sub-Divisional Magistrates to contact the Department issued instructions. AHW Bentick was then the Commissioner of the Assam Valley. He was appointed the unpaid Provincial Director of the department. He also appointed Sir JP Mills (Commissioner of Kachar District) and Professor Surya Kumar Bhuyan of Cotton College as Unpaid Assistant Directors of Surrma Valley and Brahmaputra Valley. The importance of establishing this department for research and study of history alone cannot be underestimated. The government did see that the work of the Department of Ethnography had increased significantly and it was completely preoccupied with the research and practice of ethnology of various ethnic groups and had no time for historical research. This is the reason why the government had to open the Department of History and Archaeology. The Officiating Chief Commissioner of Assam, recognizing the importance of historical and archaeological research, sent a note to the Government on 18 July 1894 saying: The time has come to save the historical books hitherto preserved in this province from destruction. Collection and preservation of &amp;#39;history&amp;#39; and similar resources scattered in the districts of the Assam Valley</content>

<content>Sir Charles Lyall and Sir Edward Gait, the Ahom priests, collected many resources in this way Sir Gate was succeeded by Col. Mr. PRT Gurdon. His achievements include the collection and publication of Assamese proverbs, the recovery of an old Chinese metal plaque from Kumar Chandranarayan Singh of the Ahom dynasty, his essays on Assamese coins, and his essays on Maran, Khamati and Ahom. In 1920, Mr. Gordon left Assam. He was succeeded by Dr. A.S. Mr. JH Hutton. In terms of ethnology, both published many books on hill tribes such as Khasi, Mikir, Kachari, Luchai-Kuki, Meitei (in the days of Gordon) and Chema, Angami, Lotha and Ao Naga. There is no time for historical studies and research in the department of discoveries and studies, which is important in ethnology. Therefore, the Government had to create the Department of History and Archeology as mentioned earlier Since then, the department has been at the forefront of historical studies and research and has been working on the recovery and preservation of old books. There is also an Ahom Studies Branch for the preservation of Ahom history and old manuscripts of the Ahom people. The Provincial Budget for 1929-30 provided Rs. The department started its work on 15 July 1929 in Guwahati under the supervision of Professor Surya Kumar Bhuyan. He was assisted by Radhanath Hazarika, Upendra Nath Sharma and Jeev Chandra Nath in 1929-3 From March 1931, Dharmakanta Sharma, Trailokya Nath Goswami, Laxmikant Sharma, Pushpakant Barkatki, Gunaram Dekak and from March to June Anandaram Buragohain were engaged in copying the manuscripts</content>

In August 1931, AHW Bentick went on eight months leave and was appointed Provincial Director. Two assistants of the 136th department, Basudev Mishra and Madhav Chandra Barua, worked temporarily in the department. From 1 April 1931, Nandanath Deodhai appointed Fukan for a period of six months. 40/- per month as salary. Deodhai Fukan was satisfied with his excellence in teaching the Ahom language and appointed him for another three months.

The library of this department is very rich. 137 The Ahom scholar Nandanath Fukan collected many inscriptions written in the Ahom language. He brought several counting books called &amp;#39;Din-Chawa&amp;#39; (good day watching) and submitted them to the department. One such book was written on velvet cloth by an ancestor of Rudra Singh Swargadeo. He collected two important Ahom-Assamese dictionaries translated another Ahom history (up to the execution of Maniram Dewan) into Assamese Sir George Greeson expressed surprise at these and wrote : The Assamese are justly proud of their national literature than in a branch of study in which India, as a rule, is curiously deficient The &amp;#39;Buranjis&amp;#39; as they are styled by the Assamese are numerous and voluminous. Sir Edward Gait, while working as the unpaid Director of the Department of Ethnography, appointed Golap Chandra Barua as the Ahom translator.

<content>He was appointed by the Government of Assam to translate the Ahom Buranji into Assamese with the help of a scholar from Sivasagar district who was appointed by the Government of Assam to translate it into Assamese. The &amp;#39;Ahom Buranji&amp;#39; contains a very brief account of the reign of Rudrasingh Swargadeo. However, at that time, Barua expressed the opinion that the information from the death of Gadadhar Singh to the reign of Lakshmi Singh in another Ahom history also covered the reign of Rudra Singh, but the book was not translated. Therefore, he wrote that the Ahom Buranji was incomplete because that part was not included in the Ahom Buranji. (The five scholars are mentioned later.) 138 However, Golap Chandra Barua translated this history into English with the help of five Ahom scholars and also translated it into English in 1930 with the assistance, approval and funding of JR Conningham, then Director of Education does. The author is proud to say that the &amp;#39;Raj Buranji&amp;#39; we have collected contains details of the reign of His Majesty Rudra Singh and the history of Rudra Singh was translated by Professor Yogendra Nath Fukan and the famous Tai-Ahom scholar Ye Ham Buragohain They have done it.

<content>CHAPTER VII The Great Flood of the Tai-Ahom and the Myth of Creation The story of the Great Flood is recorded in ancient writings. It is called &amp;#39;Laitu&amp;#39; in Tai-Ahom manuscripts. Sir Edward Gate first published such a narrative in 1894 in the Bengal Asiatic Society Journal, Volume 63, Volume I, Book 2, page 108, in 1894 AD. There are many different types of characters in the film, but the most important one is the character of Laitu or Lao Fala. His &amp;#39;Ahom Buranji&amp;#39; also briefly mentions this great flood. Cochrane published another version of the same story from Rangoon in 1915 in The Shach, Volume 1. The story of the giant Lao is widely known among the Tai peoples of Black Tai, White Tai, Lao, etc The plants are said to have been tied together by Pu Thaen, the grandfather of the sky god, who cut the connection between the earth and the sky Pu-than had seven children and the seventh child was Krishna, her ancestor</content>

<content>142 Tai-Ahom Great Flood and. &amp;quot;In the beginning the heavens and the earth were tied close together. Then came the Flood. After the Flood, Pu Than made a man of clay and placed him inside a huge stick. (White-Tai tale) &amp;quot;Pu-Than was angry and nothing happened. People stopped worshiping him. So he caused a great flood. Then he sent a bull to earth. When the bull died, a huge stick came out of the womb He sent seven sons of Khun Burm to rule the kingdom in seven directions.” &amp;quot;There was a huge Lao. The story of the Great Flood tells how the waters dried up and died in the heat of the sun. The earth burst with the heat of the sun; the hot water killed all animals The boat reached Mount Iba in the northeast and the gods could not bear the stench of the dead bodies of humans and birds There was a tree, and its branches grew in all directions. The branches of the tree in the west died in the cold</content>

<content>The Great Flood of the Tai-Ahom and 143 giant Lao grew. Landon&amp;#39;s eldest son, Ai Falan, heard the cries of the animals inside the stick, the basis of all kinds of animals, and sent lightning to tear the stick. Whenever he points to strike the lightning, he hears a cry, “Save, save, don&amp;#39;t kill, don&amp;#39;t kill.” An old man named Thailipe Ling then came forward to sacrifice himself. Therefore, Thao Lip Ling is still worshiped by the Ahom priests to commemorate the sacrifice made by the Ahom priests to save the animals trapped in the lao by striking lightning to strike Ai Falan for the creation of man. Otherwise, these animals might have been trapped in the giant gourd and humans and other animals would not have been created on earth. Towards the end of Kali Yuga, the world was divided into many small and large states. But there was no king in these. As a result, there was a stalemate on earth, and no one cared about anyone else. There was no peace and security among them. They became gross sinners and stopped worshiping God. At that time, Khun-Phi and Puk Phi appeared in the country called Mong Klang (Middle Kingdom). They started running away when they saw them but they assured them of safety and brought them back. After this, Khun Phi became their king and Puk Phi became the nominal prince. They appointed some chief men as ministers and officers. Therefore, it is important to understand the importance of these issues. Therefore, it is important to understand the importance of these issues. But the people remained indifferent to religion and did not worship God. No one felt the need to worship God.

<content>144 The Great Flood of the Tai-Ahom and.. .... God did not even exist. Worship of God was completely ignored. The gods were upset by the lack of worship from the people and went to Landon, the lord of heaven. The gods urged Landon to introduce the laws of God and god worship among the people. For if you do not do this, you will become more and more sinful and unrighteous. Lord Langdon learned of this demonic nature of man and wanted to punish him. He immediately sent New-Fa-Fa (the king of birds, Garuda) to Mart and ordered him to swallow people one by one. There was terror among the people when the eagle king came and started the process of swallowing people on earth. But the eagle&amp;#39;s stomach was so small There were countless people. So Garuda was able to devour only a small number of people. Moreover, the eagle cannot move when its stomach is full. So the wicked men took this opportunity to surround Garuda and beat him so that the king of birds almost died. After the people left the king of birds, he regained consciousness and managed to reach Landon. Newfie explained everything to Langdon. Landon was angry and immediately expelled New-Fak from heaven. Then Langdon sent a terrible lion to appease the wicked sinners. But the lion had the same eating power as the eagle. The same thing happened to the lion as to the king of birds, New-Fa-Fa. One day, after the youths of a village surrounded him and beat him badly, the lion fled to heaven and told Landon, the king of the gods. Lord Landon was angry at this. He felt guilty for not being able to punish the gods and the people who had dishonored God. of heaven</content>

<content>He sent envoys twice from the Great Flood of the Tai-Ahom and .... but he could not fascinate the people with religion. He burst into rage and humiliation. This time Langdon sent a large number of poisonous snakes to attack the men. These poisonous snakes began to descend like clouds from the sky to the earth. Despite such a terrible sight, the brave young men of the country bravely tied bundles of straw together and set them on fire towards the herd of snakes. The snakes were blinded by the smoke of the fire and many were burned. and the few that remained, which fell to the ground, the people smote them with the edge of the sword. 145 Devaraj Landon fainted with grief and humiliation at the failure of several attempts. The next day he summoned the sun god and ordered him to use all his power to heat the whole earth. The sun god then sent powerful rays from his body to the mortals and began to absorb the waters of the earth. Within a very short time, the rivers, lakes, ponds, etc. dried up The inhabitants of the earth were distressed by the lack of water on the one hand and the intense heat of the sun on the other. The aquatic animals died for lack of water. The trees, the shrubs, and the grass began to wither, and cracks appeared everywhere on the surface of the earth. Many people died due to lack of water. But they did not regain consciousness to worship God. They began to spend their time in the midst of their former immorality. Who will be able to correct these people whose hearts are filled with sinful desires and evil thoughts? Landon then thought that the earth should not be the home of the most sinful and unrighteous people. If we fail to empower these people, we are not worthy of being gods.</content>

<content>The Great Flood of the Tai-Ahom and. Landon decided to cause a great flood on earth by causing heavy rains. To this end he sent for the gods for a consultation. When the gods and goddesses Cheng-kai-fa, Then-kham, Lao-khri, Tai Lang, Baklang, Chao-fakun and Jachingpha met, Landon expressed his intentions. All the gods and goddesses agreed with the decision of the king of the gods. Jasingfai then said that Langdon should confer with Ai-Khang-Khak (a sage) before contemplating the destruction of the earth. Ai-khang-khak was then in penance near a lake in the Himalayas. Jachingphai argued that he should be sent to Thau-lip-ling and that only through him would a new creation be possible after the destruction of the earth. At the invitation of the king of the gods, Ai-Khang-Khak came to meet Landon. When the sage entered the royal court, the gods stood up to greet him and seated him on a golden throne. After this, secret talks were held between Devaraj Landon and I-Khang-Khak. At the end of the discussion, Ai-Khang-Khak informed the gods that he was ready to meet Thau-Lip-Ling to implement the decision of the god King Landon Then the king dissolved the royal assembly and entered his secret chamber with Ai-Khang-Kha. Therefore, it is important to understand the importance of these two aspects. The first aspect is to understand the importance of these two aspects. Thao-lip-ling was patrolling his flower garden and greeted Ai-khang-khak as soon as he saw him. They sat down under a poplar tree. Ai Khang-Khak said that the reason for his visit was strictly confidential and that no one else should know about the discussion between the two. He said that on the 25th day of Dinchir (Fagun) the great flood would begin on the earth. 146. 146</content>

<content>&amp;quot;Landon has told you to make a stone wall and keep it ready at the door of your house. The whole earth will be flooded in the flood and all living things will die. Then you and I will climb this wall to save lives You must not take your wives or your sons here.” Thao Lip Ling was saddened to learn this. He was saddened to learn that his wife and son would have to be left alone in the devastation of the flood. Nevertheless, he detached himself from pleasures and agreed to act on Landon&amp;#39;s instructions. Then I-khang-kha returned to the king of the gods, Landon, and told him the whole conversation with Thaulip-ling. Meanwhile, Thaulip-ling brought about ten large stones, built a wall, and placed them at the door. Thai-lip-ling was silent while the ground was being built. He didn&amp;#39;t even talk to anyone. Before that cursed day, I-khang-kha came to I-lip-ling&amp;#39;s house. They invited friends and relatives to a dinner party. Because he knew that he would never see anyone again after the Flood. The two sages spent the night discussing religion and reading the holy scriptures. Thau-lip-ling, however, did not inform anyone in his family of the potential danger the next day. Early the next morning, Landon ordered Chao-fun (Varun) to cause a great flood on the earth with a rain of hot water. Instantly, black clouds sounded the alarm bell in the sky and heavy rain began to fall on the earth. People, animals and plants were all drowned in the hot water. On the other hand, the rock floated in the water and finally it</content>

<content>The Tai-Ahom flood and .... caught up with the peak of a mountain. Here the field was stopped and Aikhang-khak, Thao-lip-ling and the leopard cows they had taken with them got off. 148 Thao-lip-ling, on the other hand, fell under the influence of vampires. The demon made him lustful and he had sexual relations with the cow. The cow carried the seeds of the sage in her body. When all the people and animals were destroyed and washed away by the flood, the king of the gods Landon struck lightning and dried up some of the water, revealing the bodies of the dead people and animals. The bodies already smelled rotten. Unable to bear this smell, the gods complained to Langdon. Landon then sent 1 million snakes to swallow the bodies. But these snakes were unable to swallow the bodies. Langdon then sent two million lions to Mort for the same purpose. But the number of dead arrows was so great that the lions were able to eat only a few. Landon then summoned the god Chao-fa-fai (fire) and ordered him to swallow the bodies. Accordingly, Chao-Fa-Fai descended to mortals and split into two parts and began to burn everyone from east to west. Meanwhile, Thao-Lipling was terrified of the blazing fire. He killed the leopard with a heavy stick and pulled out all its females and eyebrows. Then he called Ai-Khankhak and went into the navel of the cow to escape the wrath of the fire. Thao-lip-ling found a garlic seed in the cow&amp;#39;s stomach. Ai-Khang-Khak advised to plant this seed in a piece of land on the top of the mountain. The gourd grew in such a way that it crossed its peak in a few days. When I heard that the seedling had grown</content>

<content>149 Devaraj Landon ordered Khun-Theu-Nek to fertilize the roots of the seedling. Khun-theu-ren came to earth and fertilized the root of the seedling and returned to heaven. Then Landon ordered the rain clouds to rain gently on the seedling. The seedling had already planted a jatilao and it was growing in size. Seeing the tree growing in size, Landon entrusted Chawla-Pao with the care of the tree. As promised, Chao-la-pao came and took care of the seedling. A month later, Landon called his eldest son I-fa-len and gave him a thunderbolt and said, &amp;#39;You will find a jatilao tree on the top of Mount Tangsu and there you will see a large jatilao. With this lightning weapon you will cut the jatilao in two and a new creation will begin.” At the king&amp;#39;s command, Ai-Fa-len went to Mount Tangsu and saw Thao-Lipling and Ai-Khang-Kha And I heard a voice saying, “O God! Don&amp;#39;t kill us. We have done nothing to make you angry. We will be kings on earth. I will rule over the nations and worship God.” Surprised by this, I-Fa-len was about to make friends with the Jatilao from the other side. Don&amp;#39;t kill us. We are she, we will rule the land.” I-Falen was confused about how he could obey his father&amp;#39;s orders</content>

<content>He was watching the great flood of the Tai-Ahoms and... and he began to address Ai-Fa-len, &amp;quot;O prince! Don&amp;#39;t worry. I am on this stick and you throw lightning at me. Ai-fa-len accepted the call, while Chao-la-pa sat on the lao and said to the animals, &amp;quot;O living beings, I offer this body for your salvation. You shall worship me by offering cattle once a year, You must suffer.” With this, Chao-la-pa told Ai-phalen to perform his duty. 150 After this, Ai-fa-len hurled a thunderbolt at Chao-la-paw. The thunder cracked the gourd and the body of Chao-la-paw was shattered. A heavenly light came out of Chao-la-Pav&amp;#39;s head and went to Devpuri and lived with the gods. A demon came out of his chest and settled on a bamboo tree. The sun was born from his right eye and the moon from his left eye and stood in the sky. Nectar flowed from his eyelids, gold and silver from his nose. Fire came out of his throat and vampires were born from other parts of his body. The lightning strike gave birth to thousands of Tai people, Mles, Yavanas, Nagas, Mikirs and Kacharis from within the Jatilao. At the same time, various animals came out of the cave. However, no Hindus came out of it. The people who came out of Jatilao were known as Tai-Kalangia-Ahom. Rice and many other things came out of the belly of the jatilao.</content>

<content>The earth was destroyed in the Great Flood of the Tai-Ahom and 151 Lakani Thausinga (9th century). In Kamut (20th century) the earth was burnt and hardened by fire. In the year Kapchan (21 Shaka), a new creation was made possible from the jatilao. The Tai Kalang Ahom settled on the banks of the river and started agriculture. The Snes and the Yavanas headed elsewhere in search of the plains. In the later stages, the seeds of Hinduism were planted in the Ahom clan through Tai-Khang-Khak. I-Khang-Khak was born from the navel of God. The Hindus lived in the plains. The food and other items that came out of the pot were distributed equally among all by Ai-fa-len, who advised Thao-lip-ling and Ai-khang-khak to develop piety and morality and returned to heaven. I-Fa-Len went to heaven and told Landon, the king of the gods, everything. The following year, in view of the unsuitability of living things on Earth, Landon ordered I-Fa-Lane to sow four species of seeds. The first was a creature that could fly in the sky, the second was a creature that could swim in water, the third was a creature that grew from the earth, and the fourth was a creature that could move from one place to another. (Urun,Burun, Gajan and Gaman) Taifa-len sowed the seeds of these four species. This is the beginning of life and plants on Earth. There were three species of animals: terrestrial, aquatic and flying. For about six years, Thao-Lip-Ling and I-Bang-Thak controlled the movements of the human species. Later, King Landon sent his two grandsons, Khun-Lung (the eldest prince) and Khun Lai (the youngest prince), to rule the earth along with many other heavenly councils and common people. They descended an iron ladder to earth. They mu-ri-mu-ram (where there is no king</content>

According to Tai-Ahom folklore, the origin of the Ahom from Jatilao suggests that the origin of the Ahom is related to the Tai of the southeast. The idea of creation of life from Jatilao is found in folklore of the Tai Ahom, Burmese, Tai Yai, Yunnan and Zhuang and Black Tai Lao.

<content>CHAPTER VIII The Religion of the Ahom The Ahom brought with them from Myung Maolung when they entered Assam under the leadership of Tai Yuvraj Su-ka-pha, the founder of the Ahom kingdom and ancestor of the Ahom dynasty I think it is appropriate to present an analysis of the scriptures. It can be said with certainty that the most important scripture of the Ahom people is &amp;#39;Lit Lai Pak Pen Ka Ka&amp;#39; This book can also be called the Bible of the Ahom people. This is where the Ahom philosophy of God lies. It is indeed of great religious significance that the &amp;#39;Pak Pen Ka Ka&amp;#39; speaks of an omnipresent, omnipresent, omnipotent God; But he is formless. This almighty being is referred to as “Fa Tuo Ching Broom Hum” or &amp;#39;Fra&amp;#39; for short in the Pak Pen Kaka Book. The concept of a formless God is unique in that it reflects the minds of those who advocate it and is in fact the most advanced of any religious philosophy. The thought of a formless God requires an extraordinary human mind. God thought or</content>

<content>154 AHOM RELIGION This greatly improves such mental meditation in religious belief. However, this does not mean that other gods and goddesses did not exist among the Ahom. This holy scripture clearly tells how &amp;#39;Fra Two Ching from Hum&amp;#39; created the gods and goddesses. This almighty, formless God and the gods and goddesses he created are the basis of the Ahom religious beliefs. Other important manuscripts describe the worship of Landon, whom the Ahoms held in the highest position. These scriptures are (1) Khek Phi Fa-Nuru Landon and (2) Lit Khamphi Landon Lanmu. One of the most important religious practices of the Ahom people is Furalung, the worship of the Ahom gods and goddesses without any sacrifices. The following manuscript contains detailed descriptions of the Furalung religious night rituals This book is the Furalung The Furalung book tells about the concept of &amp;#39;Fura&amp;#39; that the dead take the form of &amp;#39;Fi&amp;#39; or &amp;#39;Dam-Fi&amp;#39; and eventually go to heaven. We think that in the beginning Umpha Puja was mainly limited to the worship of the Ahom gods and goddesses. Even when Chu-ka-phai defeated the local tribes and conquered their kingdoms, the local gods and goddesses did not have a place in this worship. It was not until many days later that their gods and goddesses were also included in the Umpha Puja according to local beliefs. The two scriptures on the method of Umpha worship are the Khek-phi Umpha and the Umpha phi Kun-an Lao. Other religious rituals of the Ahom are (1) Rik Khan and (2) Dam-fi. The two related scriptures are (1) Rik Khun and</content>

<content>Ahom Religion 155 &amp;#39;Dam-fi-chi fun-rik khun&amp;#39; Rick Khun describes her religious practices for longevity. Another important custom celebrated by the Ahom is the Nang Hun Fa or Chaklong (wedding festival) and the related scriptures are (1) Nang Hun Fa and (2) Chaklong. These religious books describe the religious customs associated with the wedding ceremony. Interestingly, there is also a story of a great flood called &amp;#39;Laitu&amp;#39; or &amp;#39;Lao-Phala&amp;#39; among the Ahom. The scriptures on this subject are (1) Lit Laitu and (2) Lao-Phala. All these scriptures are in handwriting in the Ahom language and script. Now let us analyze these scriptures one by one. In order to get a brief idea of the traditional and basic beliefs and religious thought of the Ahom people, we will try to give a brief note on these scriptures and religious customs. &amp;#39;Pak Pen Ka Ka&amp;#39; is a myth of creation from the earliest times before the evolution of living things on Earth. The text of this scripture suggests that the Ahom believed in the existence of only one omnipresent God and that this great God hung like a swarm of bees in space. This great god &amp;#39;Fa&amp;#39; Tu Ching From Hum&amp;#39; created &amp;#39;Khunthenkham&amp;#39; from his own chest. This story also contains an account of the creation of the earth. According to this account, the earth was created from the droppings of a pair of golden spiders, and eight huge pillars hold the earth, the mountains, and the sky, or heaven (which is in the shape of a golden throne). Then Lord Fry created a goddess as his wife, him</content>

<content>The Ahom religion gave them genitals and engaged in sexual activity themselves. The goddess laid four eggs. Later, seeing that the eggs did not hatch, the fry brought the nectar &amp;#39;Ya Pulak&amp;#39; and sprinkled it on it, and the eggs hatched and four sons were born. The eldest son, Fasangdinkhunnyen, became ruler of the earth. The second son, Seng Kampha, was made the ruler of the eight hundred thousand snakes that lived in the sea. The third son, Senkampha, was given the responsibility of eight million thunderbolts. Numalia&amp;#39;s son Ning Gaokham was asked to stay with him and help him in the creation of the earth. He was named &amp;#39;Fura&amp;#39; Later, Senkamphai succumbed to delusion and acted against the will of God. As a result, he died and became an evil spirit. Senkapha became king and after his death was transformed into a house god. Then Almighty God sent a wise man named Humkhangam to the foggy part of heaven and told him to stay there. He was entrusted by God with the responsibility of determining social and religious customs. God created another learned man named Fukao. A man named Ngaokham was standing in the north corner of the north in the glory of Rajeshwar and was engaged in deep meditation. Many ages later, a god named Pofisu, who lived in Kangrai with nine thousand followers, came down and found Ngaokham in deep meditation. He made Ngaokham king of Phungklingkh. His youngest son, Fasi Ip-Changdin, became king of the country called Fakokhraj. He had four sons. The eldest son, Ising, was made king of the fairyland. The son of Numalia, Chaodakham, was made king of Khunglai and sent there. Dakham married a princess named Nang Chengdao. He went down to a mountainous kingdom called Umu and began to reign there.</content>

<content>He had four sons. One of them was named &amp;#39;Phasangfau&amp;#39; Another son of three heads drowned. The youngest son was named Viringkham. He was also called Langdon. She was also known as Cyrepha, derived from the placenta. Langdon&amp;#39;s fair sister Sangsengdao was married off to Dakham. Dakham&amp;#39;s sister was married to Kanzhan Pha, king of Phungnapha and Yunklingkhu. 157 Landon descended into the realm of the gods and became king there. It was called Zadip (meaning the land of the immortals) because Jayapul was sent there. He was made lord of eight hundred thousand thunderbolts and lightnings Chao Dakham had a son named Chentaonyenkaipha Thenkham. He came down and became king at a place called Muthila. His grandchildren were named Khulung and Khun Lai. They descended on a golden ladder to earth and began to rule over the earth. Thus, this scripture gives a detailed account of the creation of the gods and how God made the earth, the heavens, the waters, and the mountains. This book also gives an overview of the heavenly kingdoms ruled by various gods in heaven. Landon, the god-king of this heavenly kingdom, is a descendant of the almighty Phra or Phura. The most famous deity worshiped by the Ahom in all their religious ceremonies is Landon. Landon is the deity worshiped by the Ahom. The above creation theory describes who Landon was and how he became a descendant of Almighty God. Now let us see what is contained in the holy scriptures &amp;#39;Khek-fi-fa-puru Landon&amp;#39; and &amp;#39;Lit Khamfi Landon Lanmung&amp;#39; Khek- fi- fa-poru Langdon contains a detailed description of the religious rites of worship of the god Langdon.

<content>158 AHOM RELIGION An altar is built high on four pillars of palm trees for the worship of Landon. Other deities worshiped at the same time are Khaokham (water god), I Landin (lord of the earth) and Jan Saihung (master of the gods). Offerings to the gods include indigenous liquor made from rice, boiled bananas, ripe bananas, soft rice, corn, sweets, jaggery, coconuts wrapped in pan, whole coconuts and rice (khaokhem). All these things are offered on a high altar. In addition, a chicken is cut, its chest and stomach are cut and filled with boiled rice and boiled eggs and offered on the altar. A piglet is sacrificed to Fa-nur-Langdon, I Langdin and Langdon&amp;#39;s seven sons (jakrua) and the boiled blood of a bull is offered to Fa-nuru Langdon. Lit Khamphi Landon Lanmu also tells how Fanuru Landon&amp;#39;s Halung Hofi has been worshiped since ancient times and how Jan Saihung, I Landin, Khaokham, Chit Lamcham (seven sons of Fa-Nuru Landon) and Mutkum Taikum (Moon and Sun) have been worshiped along with him since ancient times According to this account, the sacred chinkara flowers are offered on a high altar (Maihang) on a palm tree pillar and coconuts cut on clean palm leaves are offered. Sweets, ripe bananas and boiled bananas are offered in vessels made of rice. Afterwards, a chicken is sacrificed with three eyes of ripe bananas, chopped rice and three duck eggs offered for &amp;#39;khao -kham&amp;#39; purposes.</content>

<content>This time we are going to analyze what is in the book &amp;#39;Phura Lung&amp;#39; This book tells a similar story of how the almighty God Fa Tu-ching-Frong-hum created the universe. According to this story, God (Fra) created two golden spiders, Fu-Kaokham. They built eight pillars and our earth was created from their feces. Then they had sexual relations and created the gods and goddesses, humans and animals and birds, all things moving and living. There was no ruler in Mu-phi. A god named Puk-fi appeared and began to rule there. But his rule began to lead to injustice and irregularity. Then Hen Putkhing took the form of Phura, and the king of Mu-phi followed the path of Phura in his rule. This event established unity and harmony among the kingdoms of the gods. The story of Nemi Mang Phurai Jao, who ruled in Bithila under the name of Cheng Bong Phura, is that Nemi Mang Phurai ruled in Bithila under the name of Cheng Bong Phura Landon, who ruled Muphi, followed the same principles as Nemi Mang Phura, who ruled Mu-phi until Khun Yeu Nang For forty thousand years, Landon ruled the god Mu-fi as the original god of all living things, and therefore there was always peace and order in his kingdom.</content>

<content>160 Ahom Religion Furalung is the worship of the virtues and righteous principles of life and values the honesty and dignity of man. Legend has it that Chaolung Du-ka-fai brought the Furalung scripture (Nom Mang Phura) with him and that Tengrai Mo&amp;#39;sai, son of the prominent scholar Senka Luk Mo Sai, wrote the Furalung in the fourteenth century during the reign of his son Chu-teo-pha. This scripture says that in the beginning Phura had no form or shape but shone like a bright flame in the vacuum. This scripture also mentions the lighting of one hundred and one lanterns, and it is said that even Fa-nuru-Langdon praises the act of burning one hundred and one slums on the high altar. During the Furalung Puja, the holy scripture &amp;#39;Pak Pen Ka Ka&amp;#39; is placed on the altar and 101 lanterns are lit. A very holy atmosphere is created and all people pray to Almighty God (Fura) to deliver them from sorrow, misfortune and evil intentions and grant them peace In short, Phuralung Puja means paying homage to the god Phura, worshiping the great Alang. It is clearly stated that Fura is implicit in the holy Pak Pen Ka Ka and Fura is the enlightening power. Therefore, the worship should be performed in a very humble manner and without any bloody sacrifices. The Rik Khun book contains detailed descriptions of the rituals required for the Rik Khan (prolonging life). This religious ceremony is held from house to house for the welfare of the family but is also celebrated collectively. Rik-khan was celebrated at different times during the reign of the Ahom kings The king held this ceremony publicly at the time of the coronation of the king or when the king won a battle, or when there was a prophecy of evil. When the Ahom kings won a battle, they wished the welfare of all the kings and subjects</content>

<content>The Ahom religion 161 (Deoshal) celebrated this festival. Rik-khun ceremonies are also performed to redeem a person from the sins of his misdeeds. In this ritual, offerings are made to the gods and goddesses and &amp;#39;ya-pulak&amp;#39; (nectar) is sprinkled on them. The priests chant mantras of the gods and goddesses and sacrifice a chicken. Then he burns the feathers of the chicken, rips open the chest, and removes the veiny eyebrows. The chicken is then roasted in soybean oil, salt and finely chopped ginger and offered to the gods on a high altar. The chicken is offered with a basket of rice and boiled eggs. The chicken is also given some rice as a symbol of feeding. The Ahom priests offer these offerings to the gods with the appropriate mantras. After this ceremony, the priests immerse the gods (baitang). After the immersion, the worshipers and guests are treated to puja bhog and drinks. The priests usually sit on palm leaves to perform this puja. The worshipers (ie family members or those who are offering worship) are not given anything to sit on. They should be on their knees to pray. The first level describes the extensive rituals of worship offered to Janchaihung, Lareng, Langdon and Jasingpha in addition to Lankuri in the Dam Phi Fun Kka Rik Khun. In the second stage, worship is offered to the Dams (spirits of the dead). The priests first invoke the gods and goddesses and offer the rituals. Then the Dam-fi worshiped the dead, i.e. Ghai-dam (chief dead god ) Chiren-dam (collective dead god) and N-dam (non-dead god), usually the parental dam</content>

<content>162 Ahom religion. Finally, the priests sprinkle water and immerse the gods (baitang). The “Nangkha Umpha Book” contains detailed descriptions of the rituals of Umpha worship. It tells how Umpha Puja first came into being. In order to establish unity and harmony between the Ahom and non-Ahom peoples of his kingdom like Maran, Barahi, Chutia etc., Chaolung Chu-Kapha introduced this puja by including the traditional Ahom gods and goddesses as well as the gods and goddesses worshiped by the local people. In addition to the Ahom gods worshiped in Umpha Puja, local gods and goddesses and marginal gods are worshipped. In this puja, white calves/cows are offered (sacrificed) to the Ahom deity Fa-Nuru-Landon and chickens, goats, pigs, dogs, bulls, ducks etc. are sacrificed to the local gods and goddesses. When this puja is done only for the welfare of a family/householder, only the goddesses Ain- Bhani, Saru Bauli, Bar Bauli, Aghari Bauli and Dongdangia, Gosani are worshipped. Gosani is given different names in different places, such as Lakhim in the paddy barn, Nang Chichao in the backyard garden, Gosani on the roadside, Subchini inside the house and the wife of the water god Khaokham on the banks of the river. This rule clearly shows that the Ahoms were influenced by Shakti Puja or Devi Puja when they first arrived in Assam as the ancient inhabitants of the country, mainly Chutia, Barahi, Maran and Kachari, worshiped Kechaikhati or Budhi Gosani, the most powerful goddess of the region. It is not surprising that during his exile in this region of the country, Chu-ka-fai also adopted the gods and goddesses worshiped by the local people in order to establish unity and harmony among the ethnic groups of the region</content>

<content>They had to practice the Ahom religion. Because he realized that it was impossible to achieve effective unity in society without adopting the main religious practices. Chuka-Fai understood the mentality of the people very well and that is why he was so successful. Nang-n-pha describes the wedding of Landon to Nang Han Pha, daughter of the Molung guru Kanjanpha. Here is an account of how Langdon, led by Guru Molaowi, became the pani candidate of Nang-hon-phra and how that marriage ceremony was performed. The book &amp;#39;Chakklong&amp;#39; contains detailed descriptions of various customs of the wedding ceremony. Preparation of moral in chak-long is very important. This stool can also be straight ; Or it can be in the shape of a lotus. These pearls are decorated in seven colours. The four sides of the morl are covered with eight small banana plants. Then, with the chanting of the priest&amp;#39;s mantra, one hundred and one slums were lit. Four brass plates are decorated with flowers, rice and pan. A Hodan is placed in one of them. As soon as the groom arrives, he is welcomed and seated near the mortal and then the bride is brought to the place and seated near the groom. The priests adore and recite mantras to Langkuri, Zanchaihung, Fa-Nuru-Langdon and Jachingpha after which the bride’s father (or, in the father’s absence, her male guardian) formally hands the bride over to the groom in marriage. The priest and the bride and groom offer flowers and rice to the gods. The women shout and wish the bride and groom well. Then the bride hands the hendan to the groom. He also gives the bridegroom a holy garment. The priest and the elders gathered in the wedding hall bless the bride and groom. They also advise the bride and groom on the practical aspects of marriage and conjugal life.</content>

<content>164 AHOM RELIGION They also mention the men as well as the two families, they also tell the story of Nang Hun Pha&amp;#39;s sacred marriage to Landon, the god of heaven. Thus, the Ahom scriptures contain detailed instructions on their traditional religious customs. However, the subtle changes in the religious practices prevalent among the Ahom can only be known by personal observation of the actual methods and detailed methods of observing these rituals. The religious concepts associated with these customs and the obligation to observe them in practice formed the basis of the religious philosophy of the Ahoms. In this study, we would like to focus on the actual methods of observing these religious practices as they are practiced today. Since these customs are actually practiced in the households of the Tai Ahom priests, we will focus on the religious rituals performed in their households. In this regard, the Ahom priestly community (Mahung, Changbun, Maplong ie Mohan, Deodhai, Bailung) determines the rituals of various pujas/festivals on the basis of ancient scriptures. In truth, they are the ones who have been strictly observing these customs. Other Tai Ahom people can also serve as priests for ceremonies such as Me-Dam-Me-Fi and Chak-Long. But the Mohans, Deodhais and Bailungs are the truly strict religious leaders and their words are the final decision in all matters. Therefore, their place in the Ahom society is very important. Let us now explore how these religious ceremonies and customs are observed in traditional Ahom villages and in traditional Ahom families. We think that no one, whether individually or</content>

<content>They do not perform religious ceremonies without sincere faith, even collectively. The following religious rituals and customs are traditionally celebrated in the Ahom villages, especially in the villages of Deodhai, Mohan and Bai Lung, and more and more people are becoming attracted to these rituals day by day. The most important religious festival widely celebrated among the Ahom is the Me-Dam-Me-Fi. We would like to discuss this important religious ceremony in two parts (1) Family or family-centric Dam Puja (worship of the ancestors of a family) and (2) Public Me-Dam-Me-Fi (public worship of all ancestors). It is called Dam Puja. In such Dam Puja, the dead god (Dam) of deceased parents, grandparents and great-grandparents is worshipped. The deceased god of the grandfather is called &amp;#39;Ghai Dam&amp;#39; (meaning the chief god) or &amp;#39;Chao Tung Dam&amp;#39; The dead god of the parents is called &amp;#39;Na-dam&amp;#39; (meaning new god) or &amp;#39;An-mou-dam&amp;#39; The ghost of the grandfather/grandfather is called &amp;#39;Chiren-Dam&amp;#39; and other ancestors are called &amp;#39;Jakrua Dam&amp;#39; or &amp;#39;Dam Thao Dam Bao Dam Likha Likhi&amp;#39; In the kitchen, located at the far north of the main residence of the Ahoms (the last room), the Ahom family erected the pillar or pole of Dam Puja according to traditional Ahom customs. This pillar is called &amp;#39;Dam-khuta (pole of the ancestral dead gods) or &amp;#39;Pho-kam pillar. The Mahans established the pillars in the west and the Deodhai Bailuts in the east.</content>

<content>166 Ahom legend has it that an ancestor of the Mahans was a descendant of the moon god (Khuntun) and an ancestor of the Deodhais was a descendant of the sun god (Khuban). The Mahans sleep on the bed with their heads facing west and the Deodhais with their heads facing east to avoid stepping on their respective dam poles. After the &amp;#39;Tilni&amp;#39; ceremony three days later and the &amp;#39;Daha&amp;#39; ceremony ten days later, the deceased god or dam of the head of the household is installed on the ancestral pillar or pole. On the tenth day after death, the dead god of the new generation is established as Na-Dam by killing a female chicken (p kari) with a branch of a honey tree and offering other items for the purpose of Na-Dam. There is a folk belief among the Ahom that there are two kinds of human souls ; One of them is called &amp;#39;Pu&amp;#39; and the other is called &amp;#39;Fu or &amp;#39;Han&amp;#39; The consciousness of the soul that the child receives from the father while in the womb is called &amp;#39;pu&amp;#39; On the other hand, when the child is exposed to air, soil, water, light and sound at birth, the &amp;#39;fu&amp;#39;ba&amp;#39; or &amp;#39;han&amp;#39; form of the soul appears. The two forms of the soul meet at birth. However, as soon as a person dies, the &amp;#39;pu&amp;#39; form of the soul takes up residence in the &amp;#39;dam-khuta&amp;#39; and is eligible for dam worship as the ancestor of the family. After three generations, this &amp;#39;pu&amp;#39; part of the soul is liberated as &amp;#39;phi&amp;#39; or &amp;#39;god&amp;#39; and is considered a deity worthy of worship in worship such as &amp;#39;um-fa&amp;#39; and &amp;#39;chai-fa&amp;#39; The &amp;#39;Fu&amp;#39; or &amp;#39;Han&amp;#39; form of the soul is beautifully buried in a tomb with the body and given a place of eternal peace. The body is placed on a palki or shavadhar and buried in the ground and a strong wall of coconut trees is erected around the grave. This is</content>

The &amp;#39;fu&amp;#39; or &amp;#39;han&amp;#39; form of the soul is placed on a palki or sharadhar according to Ahom rituals and merged with the body buried in the tomb. There is a folk belief that the &amp;#39;fu or &amp;#39;han&amp;#39; form of the soul merges with nature after a few years. That is why family members hope that the spirit will be pleased with them and leave this earth when they bury the deceased. Family Dam Puja not only worships the immediate ancestors of the family, but also the gods and goddesses of heaven such as Lankuri, the priest of heaven Janchai Hung, the god of heaven Fa-Nri-Ru-Longdon, the goddess of knowledge Ai-Chang-Sing Jasingpha and Phi-Sarye Yes. Before the &amp;#39;Khen-Khao&amp;#39; ceremony, families who believe in traditional reforms hold the family Dam Puja once a year. Block-sing-fa (chinkara) flowers are used in this Dam Puja. A high bamboo altar is erected for each deity. This is called fun or mehenga. The rituals are offered in two separate sections of the same altar for Lankuri and Jan Sai Hung. For the lankuri (block jung) cut coconut covered with lakhmi flowers is offered. Arai rice made with rice, indigenous liquor, soybean oil, ginger and salt. Two chopped coconuts wrapped in chinkara flowers, two pots of somras (luklao) and rice are offered to Jan-chai Hung on the same high altar. The seat of Phi Lareng was established after Jan Sai Hung. In this asana fun, the back of a palm leaf is placed on top and a piece of coconut cut or covered with block jung (lakhim flower) is distributed. Similarly, the rituals offered for Landon are cut coconuts wrapped in chinkara flowers, three on top of the flower, one under the altar or below, three bags of luklao on top of the flowers and one bag under the flowers. -</content>

In some families, however, Jakrua Dam is not worshipped. Only three additional men are worshipped. The offerings for the worship of the main dam are divided into three categories. Two parts on top of the fruit, one part on the bottom The items are two chopped coconuts wrapped in chinkara flowers, two bags of indigenous (humras) named lao made with rice and dead vegetables or lyshak. Similarly, the above rituals are taken in equal amounts and offered in two parts for the purpose of Chiren Dam. Three deshi (humras) or nam lao tholas made from rice, a chopped coconut and three vegetables are offered for the jackal dam. For the purpose of the new dam, one part on top of the flower and one part below all the materials are offered. One of the materials offered for each dam (mentioned above). In the Mahung family, the ghaidam is given a seat to the right of the dam-khuta; In the Deodhai and Bailung families, the seat is given on the left. The priest decorates palm leaves, banana donas, a high altar, a fun or mehenga and a bag of banana patwa and sprinkles water soaked in chinkara flowers to sanctify everything. Then the items of worship are offered in fun or mehenga on the high altars decorated for Ghai-Dam, Chiren Dam, Na-Dam etc. The priest then asks the family members to bow to the Fuchai Man by writing Ghai-Dam, Jakrua Dam, Sine Dam, Na-Dam, Dam-Khao, Dam Bao, Dam. They also beg the ghost gods to accept worship. This action is called &amp;#39;ao-tang&amp;#39; A female chicken is offered on a palm leaf in front of each altar.

At the same time, Malung offers the above-mentioned indigenous (humras) Namlao to the Dams and recites the Qin Tang mantra (of eating). Every ritual is dedicated to the spirits and gods in the Tai Ahom language. &amp;#39;Chang nay chao nu-ru chao kao oi.

The meanings of some mantras are given below to give an idea of them. Thus, Me-Dam-Me-Fi is a very important ritual of the Ahom religion. This &amp;#39;Dam-Fi&amp;#39; puja is performed along with every auspicious ceremony. However, &amp;#39;Grih Dam Puja&amp;#39; is confined to the Ahom priestly community. There are five chapters of mantras recited in the Damphi Puja ceremony held during the month of Aghon. 1. 1. Aotang = asking to participate in the puja along with chanting mantras. 2. The Kintang = chanting mantras and asking to receive objects. 3. 3. 3. Jantang = to give and receive blessings. 4. The Boi Tang = The priest bows down asking for forgiveness. 5. 5.

<content>Ahom Religion 183 Public Me-Dam-Me-Fi In almost all the cultured societies of the world, the ancestors are worshiped with their own characteristics and dignity. The Ahom, who came from the Mu Maolung region of southern China in 1228 AD, are no exception. Although their relatives in southern China, mainly the people living in the present-day Dihong-Dai-Singphou region of southern China, who accompanied Prince Chao Lung Chu-ka-pha in 1228 AD and settled in Assam, are known as Tai Ahom hall. The Ahom worship of the ancestors is called &amp;#39;Me-Dam-Me-Phi&amp;#39;. &amp;#39;Me&amp;#39; means worship, &amp;#39;Dam&amp;#39; means dead and &amp;#39;Phi&amp;#39; means god. This means that the Ahoms worship the dead as gods. The concept of divinity of the dead is very ancient and legend has it that all people of the Tai language have their own characteristics and traditions of worshiping their ancestors as gods. For example, the Dong (Kam) people living in Nan Guizhon Province and Guangxi Autonomous Region practice ancestor worship in their own way. The concept of ancestor worship is associated with the concept of immortality of the soul. After a person dies, his soul leaves the body and returns to the abode of his ancestors (ie, heaven). This is folk belief. Many families worship &amp;#39;heaven, earth, ancestors and gurus&amp;#39; in the main room of their homes. When people receive a gift from others or a newly produced product, they first offer it to their ancestors and then eat it. - The Tai Ahom believe that when a person dies, he remains a ghost and that the deceased becomes a &amp;#39;phi&amp;#39; or god only after the relatives of the deceased worship the gods and goddesses. According to Tai-Ahom belief, the human soul is not reborn after death. After death, the deceased person becomes a god and a heaven</content>

<content>They live with their relatives. They believe that if relatives or the whole society as a whole worships the ancestors (Me-Dam-Me-Fi) with devotion, the dead, especially parents and grandparents, come down from heaven to earth and wish their sons, daughters, grandchildren and others He gives blessings. Like the Tai-Ahom, the Red Tais of Vietnam believe that heaven is divided into different levels; Each level is again divided into several provinces and each clan or tribe has its own residence, village or town. Similarly, in the capital of heaven, the King of Heaven, Po-Then-Kham, lives with other gods and goddesses. Every god and goddess has &amp;#39;phi&amp;#39; or souls under him. One of the most important customs among the Ahom is that they do not cremate the dead (ie, do not burn the coffin); They put him in a coffin and buried him. This is called the &amp;#39;maidam&amp;#39; This custom is also practiced among other Thais, such as the Tho people of northern Vietnam. They perform the worship of the dead once every 49 days and once every 100 days. It is said in Ahom history that when the princes Khun-Lung and Khun-Lai were sent to earth from heaven where the god Landon reigned, the goddess Jachingphai advised them: &amp;#39;Your grandfather Lord Landon has sent you to earth to rule on earth. When the holy &amp;#39;Chinkara&amp;#39; flowers bloom in the month of &amp;#39;Din Ha&amp;#39; (Chat month), choose an auspicious day of that month and worship them by sacrificing animals and birds and offering other sweet things to appease Lord Landon and other gods and goddesses. Landon and eight hundred thousand gods and goddesses will come down to earth and bless you. This remained Landon&amp;#39;s motto for the Tai people and the Tai king. They believe that they are born in heaven; and they were sent down to earth before the princes descended to earth by the golden ladder.</content>

<content>Religion of the Ahom 185 It is also written in the history that the first Swargadeo (heavenly king) of the Tai-Ahoms, Chaolung Su-ka-fai, celebrated this sacred festival of Me-dam-me-fi and prayed for the blessings of his ancestors in his new palace. After his death, Chaolung Chu-ka-pha was buried in Charideo. His son became king and held the Madam-me-fi worship. Charideo is considered to be the Jerusalem of the East for all Tai-speakers as all the Tai-Ahom kings are buried in this holy place and the designs and carvings of the tombs have become the subject of research not only for all curious people but also for curious researchers. There are many Ahom kings in the country who celebrated the Me-Dam-Me-Fi festival every year. Only during the reign of Jayadeva Singh was Me-Dam-Me-Fi not celebrated. When the Mughal army under Mir Jumla defeated Jaidhwaj Singh, the king said to Prime Minister Atan Buragohain in deep sorrow and pain, “Gohaideu, the gods have abandoned me.” Then Gohain said, &amp;quot;Swargadeo, do not be sad. Victory and defeat are two sides of the same coin. When the gods are gracious, Swargadeo will be able to defeat foreign enemies by his own strength He thought that the gods were angry with him because his elder brother did not worship them. Therefore, the king celebrated the Me-Dam-Me-Fi festival in Charideo with great pomp under the direct supervision of Langseng Bargohai Chakradhar Singh actively cooperated and restored the lost glory of the Ahoms by winning the Battle of Saraighat</content>

<content>186 AHOM RELIGION This worship was performed several times. After crossing the Nam-kyu (Irrawaddy) river on their way to this country, Chu-ka-fai worshiped Me-dam-me-fi. After crossing the Dai-Kao Rang River, the festival was held at Namrup (Namruk) on the banks of Budhidihing to wish victory and a new kingdom to the god Landon and other gods and goddesses and ancestors. After this festival, he continued to worship his ancestors at a place called Lanteworkat in the southern part of Charideo. After that, Chu-ka-fai made his capital at Charideo and celebrated this festival to seek the blessings of his ancestors and gods and goddesses. By the end of the thirteenth century, almost all Tai people had become followers of Buddhism (the Hinyan sect). But even after their conversion, they did not abandon their ways. The Khamti, Khameang, Fake and Ait Nas offer flowers and rice to seek the blessings of their ancestors. Similarly, the Lao, Shan and Thai people of Laos, Myanmar and Thailand and the Lu and Dai people of southern China are Buddhists. Non-Buddhist Thais, like Taidam, Tai Khao Nang and Nungkal in northern Vietnam, celebrate this ceremony by offering meat and other food items to the dead. Other Ahom kings also celebrated the Me-Dam-Mephi as an annual festival The festival was celebrated by the Dihingia kings Pratap Singh, Gadadhar Singh and Pramatta Singh. The folk belief associated with the Me-Dam-Me-Fi ceremony was echoed in the words of Chakradhar Singh, “My uncle Chu-Tamlai (Jaidhwaj Singh) could not receive the blessings of Fa-Nuru and other gods because he did not worship his ancestors Our soldiers are dead or humiliated.” This festival was celebrated with great pomp until the reign of the last known king of the Ahoms, Chandrakanta Singh. There are three types of Me-Dam-Me-Fi (1) public (for the king, state and people) Me-dam-me-fi, (2) dry Me-dam-me-fi (with five high bamboo altars &amp;#39;maihang&amp;#39;) and (3) another type of domestic Me-dam-me-fi (with three maihangs or altars).

<content>188 Ahom Religion Umpha Puja: The Ahom kings performed Umpha Puja at least 16 times. The first time Umpha Puja was performed was by Chaolung Chu-ka-fai in 1253 AD when he established his capital at Che-tam-doi (Charaideo). On this occasion, he sacrificed two furry dogs under two bot trees to appease the god of the forest, Fi-hung. (Ahom History, 47). During the reign of Chaopha Chaupha Hit Pungpha, Umpha Puja was celebrated as follows. &amp;quot;Then the king summoned the Moru, Moching and Mochai Longs and ordered them to look for Mars in the chicken&amp;#39;s tail (bancheng). Accordingly, the priests examined the chicken&amp;#39;s tail and found the results favorable. A white bull, a cow, and many chickens were sacrificed to the gods, and all the gods of heaven were worshiped accordingly.” (Ahom Buranji, p. 356) - Three types of gods are worshiped in the Um-Fa worship.

<content>198 prepared the religion of the Ahoms. They themselves share the water of peace and sprinkle it on the offerings on the altars and on the animals and birds that are prepared for sacrifice. These mantras are actually nothing but prayers to the ancestors and gods. The mantra begins by bowing to the God of heaven as follows: 66 “Chao Nuru-Chao-Kao-Oi O Fi Oi Kiya Urai Ura O Chao Phra No Chao Phra Tekpin Ba” and so on. In the Ahom custom, the names of the gods are first invoked by chanting mantras. This is called Ao Tang. All the gods and goddesses are invoked and prayed to occupy the places designated for them. The priests then name the rituals of worship, the animals and birds prepared for sacrifice, and other articles of enjoyment, and invite the gods to accept them. This is called kin-tang. The priests then seek the blessings and mercy of the gods for the country and its inhabitants. This is called jan -ming. The Deuri then prophesied and ordered countermeasures to appease the gods and goddesses and prevent evil. When the Deuris dance in all three mandaps (deoshals), they sing Ahom mantras in the Bardeoshal and prayer songs in Assamese in the other two shals. While dancing, the Deuris drink the blood of the sacrificed goats and other animals and birds with their hands and make prophecies. The priests then sprinkle mantra water on the Deuris. Only then did the Deuris regain consciousness. The act of bidding farewell to the gods and goddesses is called &amp;#39;baitang&amp;#39;</content>

<content>It is called the religion of the Ahoms. After the &amp;#39;Baitang&amp;#39;, the Deuris fell to the ground, as the gods and goddesses with their bodies left them. Some time after this they regain definition (consciousness). (See Ahom Mantra of Umpha Puja in Appendix 3). Ahom mantras are not used in the worship of gods and goddesses in Hindu mandaps; Here, the mantras are recited only in Assamese. The worship is primarily aimed at the almighty Shiva (Mahadeva), the aged mother Subachani and their Pali-guardians. These include Ikola-Sikola, Yazli-Majli, Bidhi-Vidhata, Tamuli-Tekela, the goddesses of disease and epidemic, the goddess of spring (Saruai) and nine sister goddesses, Garia Raja, Maria Raja, Shel Konwar, Mal Konwar, Dhoba-Dhubuni, Panch Gharia. (See Mantras of Umpha Puja in Appendix 4). Legend has it that in the distant past there was no such thing as land or water. The moon and the sun were moving in their own orbits. The gods of heaven reigned in space. Four Siddhas built an earthen boat. The world appeared. But who saw it? Who cut off its navel? The frog crouched on the branch of the tree. The square beetle cut the navel. Brahma created, Vishnu maintained and Rudra destroyed. The gods of heaven were restored to their proper places. There was no power to destroy them. There were no gods to worship. Then the gods of human worship were created. The Great Mother, Lord Shiva and Goddess Subchani are approached to wish the welfare of all and to save them from various diseases, deaths and all kinds of evils (because they all happen because of our defection).

<content>The list of priests of 200 pujas is given in Appendix 5.) Ahom Religion One of the most important features of Ahom religion is that among all the rituals of this religion, only &amp;#39;Furalung&amp;#39; does not involve bloody sacrifice. The Ahom performed bloody sacrifices in most religious ceremonies. Only Furalung is an exception. Before giving a theoretical explanation of Furalung, it is necessary to say a few words about the preparation of Furalung ceremony in the Ahom priestly community and some other Ahom families. This event is celebrated in several ways. such as (1) celebrating the full ceremony; (2) celebrate most events; (3) Furalung celebrated by a householder for a special purpose; (4) A ceremony celebrated in a small family limited to the primary level. The following stages are compulsory for any type of Furalu event. - (1) a high altar (&amp;#39;lock&amp;#39;) equipped with seven bamboo poles for lighting clay candles; installation of &amp;#39;Pak Pen Ka Ka&amp;#39; on a high altar; (2) (3) &amp;#39;Ja-pulak&amp;#39; prepared ; (4) &amp;#39;I Ching Lao&amp;#39; means singing prayer songs. Another important point is that the food served at the ceremony must be completely vegetarian; Fish, meat, corn and liquor completely</content>

<content>Ahom Religion 201 is forbidden. No cooked or cooked food is offered. Sweets are made by mixing rice flour, jaggery, milk and honey. Rice mixed with soaked beetroot oil, neem and ginger is served with bananas, maize and other fruits and vegetables. Coconut is considered to be an essential resource in every religious ceremony of the Ahom people. Special emphasis placed on devotees (fufusing). This gives this ceremony a distinction among other Ahom religious ceremonies. These devotees invited here selected three Ahom priests to perform the special duties imposed by the assembled people. (a) Construction of the Furalung Altar: A place is first selected for the altar. The altar is made of clay or sand in an octagonal shape. In each corner, a banana plant is planted in a hole in the ground slightly away from the altar. It is recommended that sufficient space be provided for the seating of controlled devotees. The priests and their families sit on the west side of the altar. Therefore, there should be proportionate open space. On the east side, a high altar is built to house the book &amp;#39;Pak Pen Ka Ka&amp;#39; Plenty of space should be left for serving foods in pots or other containers. (b) Welcome to the priest (snak-chit) and invited guests (fuk footing): The head of the household welcomes the priest and devotees with coconuts, pan and some money on a brass plate and invites them to take seats near the altar.

If the family hosts a feast for the guests, the assembly allows selected people to cook during this time. (See Appendix-6 for the songs performed at the Furalung ceremony.) (c) Installation of the &amp;#39;Pak Pen Ka Ka Grantha: The priests now place the &amp;#39;Pak Pen Ka Ka&amp;#39; sacred book on the altar. A coin is offered on the ground for the construction of the altar. The holy scripture is placed on a large plate. There are many ways to get a job in the field of architecture, but the most important thing is to get a job in the field of architecture. The book is covered with a flowery gomocha. They can also be covered with flower petals or leaves. The gamocha is covered with three cut coconut chinkar flowers. A clay candle is lit on the right side of the Pak Pen Ka Ka. In addition to coconuts and drinks, a small amount of money is also given to the sharai. The priests who installed the &amp;#39;Pak Pen Ka Ka&amp;#39; bowed down and blessed the assembled devotees. () Preparation of Ra Pulak : Three priests shall sit on the west side of the altar facing Pak Pen Ka Ka. A copper drinking water is kept. A copper penny (or a piece of copper) is dipped into it. The vessel is also given gold and silver. The priests chant the mantra by stirring the water in the copper vessel by decorating a palm branch with a chinkar flower and tying a piece of copper to it Ya Pulak is a mixture of butter, honey, ab milk, curd, jaggery and sugar.

<content>The three first drank some of it and purified it. Some of it is then sprinkled on the altar and other rituals. It is then distributed among the devotees. (3) Lak Sajja (Stapped decoration for lighting candles) For the complete Furalong ceremony, 101 slum trees should be lit, and palm trees six or seven feet high should be cut down and buried in the ground to decorate the slum pillars. Bamboo is cut in different sizes on the columns of palm trees in seven rows from bottom to top and arranged in a conic shape from bottom to top. There is a three-faced candle at the top and four candles in the second row. There are 16 candles in each of these four rows from the third to the sixth row and 32 candles in the seventh and last row. This conical lantern is called a &amp;#39;lak&amp;#39; When the Furalung ceremony is celebrated on a small scale, only eleven candles are lit. In this case, a coin of land is paid. Clay candles are prepared with oil shalitas and lit on seven rows of slum pillars constructed as described above. The main candle at the top has only three wicks. The widely celebrated Furalung ceremony is conducted according to the &amp;#39;Nigami&amp;#39; custom; However, the ceremony is also performed according to the &amp;#39;Agami&amp;#39; custom. An equal number of kaldonas are placed in front of the &amp;#39;lak&amp;#39; (i.e. slum pillar) according to the number of candles and cut coconuts covered with chinkara flowers and some money are placed on it. Food and rituals are also placed in front of it and candles are lit with palm leaves. Once this is done properly, the &amp;#39;lak&amp;#39;, or slum theory, is ready for lighting the candle. The head of the family will light the main clay candle. The rest of the candles are offered by the priests and other devotees.</content>

<content>204 Bow to the devotees of the Ahom religion : Now the family members will bow to the devotees. The head of the household will explain the purpose of holding the furalung ceremony. The priests and Molungs will bless the family. (g) Prayer song: This is followed by the priests, devotees, family members and others gathered who sing the prayer song of God (I-ching-lao) and offer flowers to the &amp;#39;lak&amp;#39; when this song of praise is sung. (I-Ching-Lao is mentioned in Appendix 6.) 2) Family members bow and offer sharai: After I Ching Lao, family members bow to the devotees and offer sharai to them. The priests give the blessing. (i) Name singing: A priest then conducts the congregational prayer. This prayer is divided into three parts; First, the priests are bowed. This is called Mo Hung Mo Lik Molai. Secondly, there is a bow to God (fura) and finally a prayer. The first and second of these are conducted by the priests but the devotees also take an active part in them. It does not use nagara or rhythm. In this ceremony, the priest puts the names and the devotees clap their hands and sing the verse collectively. This becomes very interesting throughout the programme. (j) After the collective prayer, refreshments are arranged for the devotees assembled. However, fish, meat or eggs are not used. (k) Leak Crack: Next, the three priests read the scriptures. The high priest sings hymns to Lord Fura and Jasingpha.</content>

Then their relatives and friends bow down. (d) If the family calls for singing, the singing ceremony takes place only after the devotees have been entertained. A sharai was offered to the singers. (n) After the singing ceremony, all the hosts kneel before the assembled people. In the absence of this ceremony, the bow after the Phura-nam is the last bow of the host. (n) After this, devotees and priests give blessings (jan-ming) to the family members to celebrate Furalung. (t) After this the priests offer immersion (farewell) to God Almighty and other gods and goddesses 1 (th) Then the offerings are distributed. The priest then lowers the main candlestick at the top of the slum pillar to the ground and brings down the &amp;#39;Pen Ka Ka Dharmagrantha&amp;#39; placed on the altar. (d) Afterwards, if the host arranges a feast, all those present participate in it. Afterwards, the priests and devotees were formally bid farewell by offering sharais as a sign of respect.

<content>206 The Ahom religion has been considered to be a very important religious institution. Nowadays, this program is popular among all classes of Ahom families. The &amp;#39;Ahom Assamese En glish Dictionary &amp;#39;, compiled by Golap Chandra Barua, gives the word &amp;#39;phura-tara&amp;#39; as meaning God and the word &amp;#39;phura-tara&amp;#39; as the name of a spirit, the name of a God. However, this first dictionary does not give the meaning of the word &amp;#39;furalung&amp;#39; Fukan rightly says (in Furalung) that the scriptures relating to Furalong were limited to the Ahom priestly community (eg Deodhai, Mohan, Bailung) and were not available to the common Ahoms. It was only in the late nineteenth century when inquisitive Ahom scholars went in search of old Ahom scriptures that they discovered that the scriptures relating to Furalung were only with the Ahom priestly community. The Ahom Lexicon (Nandanath Deodhai Fukan, 64) gives the word &amp;#39;Furalung&amp;#39; as &amp;#39;religious scripture of the Ahom&amp;#39; The Ahom also celebrate the Furalung Bar Sabah without any sacrifice with offerings of beans, bananas and corn. The Chomdeu (Chumphra-rung-seng-mung) Ahom were not idolaters in their religious tradition. There is no mention of any idols in their religious books.</content>

<content>Ahom Religion 207 However, the worship of Chomdeu was limited to the Ahom royal family. There was an idol called Chomdeu in exclusive possession. Khun Lung and Khun Lai, the ancestors of the Tai kings, were sent by their uncle, King Landon of Heaven, to rule the earth from heaven. They brought with them many sacred religious rituals and sent them to Chomdev, advising them, &amp;quot;I have given you Chomdev. Never leave this idol. It is in a box. At the end of each year you must open the box You will have long life. No king will disobey you. I, the king of thunder, have sent you to earth. We have blessed you with Jashingpha and Lao-Khri.” Landon then told the origin of the idol: &amp;quot;In ancient times, Falaibet (God) sent this idol with Phabutrung Shangdam. It was under the influence of this idol that Shangdam became a very successful ruler. By worshiping this idol you will be able to rule your kingdom. You will see Chomdeu in divine dress once a year. I have given you Thaomung and Khrumungnyeu and you will never disrespect them Choose an auspicious day and take a bath, then put on clean clothes and go to the temple of Chomdev in the morning with holy water.</content>

<content>208 When you reach the temple of the Ahoms, you will kneel before the altar of the Lord and pay your respects. Then open the box and look at Chomdev. Take out the idol and wash it with holy water. You shall drink of the water. Then you put the idol inside the bus and hit the saffron. Do not let anyone else see the idol. I have given you this advice, and you must never disobey me.” Landon advised the princes to touch the ground with their heads and bow to Chumphrarungmung Lik Chumphrarung seng mung says that the Fry (the Creator) meditated on the idol or luminous gem Chumphararung Seng Mung and prayed: “O my Lord, my Lord! I beg you, listen. Phrabut rung shang dam, the creator, prays “O Chum-fa, you are the luminous jewel of the universe. You shine like the sun. By worshiping Chum-fa, peace prevails in the heavenly kingdom O my grandfather, we offer gold and silver. Only with your blessings, O Chumseng, can the king of the earth become powerful.” (Gohain: 1990: 126-127) It can be assumed that Chumfra Rung Cheng Mu is a symbolic idol of Almighty God and the Tai word &amp;#39;Chomdeu&amp;#39; is nothing but an Assamese synonymous dialect of Chumfra Rung Cheng Mu. It is also noteworthy that Chumfrarangmu</content>

<content>Ahom Religion 201 (Chumpharungmung) and Sengrungmung (Assamese Chomdeu and Chengdeu) are not two separate idols, but both refer to the same God. Chengdeu cannot be considered as a goddess or a separate idol. In fact, Chomdeu and Chengdeu refer to the almighty Lord of the universe, Chumfrarung Cheng Mung. Sometimes called &amp;#39;Chum&amp;#39; and sometimes &amp;#39;Seng&amp;#39; Ney Elias Burma in his research based on Shan sources mentions that Chung and Cheng are the images of the ancestors of Khulung and Khulai. He describes in detail how Khulung loaded a bus with two idols of his ancestors, one of a man named Chung and the other of a woman named Cheng, and headed west with the box on his head (Scott: 1900:219). This suggests that the Shans had two traditional idols and that the Ahom tradition had only one which Landon gave to his grandsons Khunlung and Khun Lai. Khulai&amp;#39;s only son, Ai Jep, had no sons, and Chomdeu or Chumfra Rang Chengmu later fell to the kings of the Khulung clan. Thus Chomdeu came into the hands of Chaolung Chu-ka-fa of the Khulung clan. Ahom history records that in lakni Katrao, the year in which his brother Chu-Khan-fa became king of Mu Maulung, Chuka-fai handed over the rule of Mu Maulung to his uncle and migrated to the west. He went to his father&amp;#39;s (Chao Changnyeu) kingdom of Mungkhu Mung Zhau. From there he took the Chumka-Rang-Cheng-Sung or Chomdeu with him. This is how Chu-ka-fa named his father Chao Changnyeu.</content>

Folio (R) } Therefore, it is clear from the basic facts mentioned in the history that Chu-ka-fai inherited from his father and brought Chomdeu from his father&amp;#39;s kingdom. The fact that Chu-ka-pha was given a fake Chomdeu by his maternal grandmother as stated in the Satsari Assam Buranji cannot be accepted as true. DHAS { folio 6 (R) &amp;amp; 6 (V) clearly states that the gift package sent by Chu-ka-fai to his sister-in-law Chu-khanpha with a letter from a distance was welcomed at the Rik-dhan festival celebration and Chu-khan-fai also sent valuable gifts. This would not have happened if the Chu-ka-fai idol had been stolen. The Ahom history mentions that this idol was in the possession of the Ahom kings who succeeded Chu-ka-pha. After the death of His Majesty Purandara Singh, the idol was stolen. The Chomdeu idol was essential in the coronation of the Ahom kings. When the King of Heaven, Landon, sent his grandsons Khulung and Khun Lai to rule the kingdom of the earth, he handed over the idol to them. Ja-chit-fai, the goddess of wisdom and learning, advised the two princes of heaven, “When you rule the earth, do not forget Fa-nuru-landon, the king of heaven Hang it around your neck.” With this, Ja-singphai took the idol of Chomdeu from Landon and gave it to Bajana Prince Khulung. According to this heavenly advice, the kings of the Ahom dynasty, the successors of Prince Khulung of heaven, built the Shingri Ghar. The Ahom king brought water from several rivers and built it on this occasion</content>

<content>The Ahom Religion 211 bathed at home. He put on white clothes. Then he rode on an elephant to the temple where Chomdeo was. He entered the temple, looked at Chomdev alone and adorned him with garlands of gold and silver. Then he hung the idol around his neck with a gold necklace. The royal procession started from the Shingri Ghar with the Swargadeo on an elephant and returned with drums and daggers. The procession was very spectacular and solemn. The elephant&amp;#39;s tusks were painted red, and the elephant&amp;#39;s body was covered with white cloth and gold ornaments around its neck. The procession came and stopped in front of the palace. The king entered the main courtyard of the fort with the idol. He put the idol on a bed. Then the king bathed again with water from several rivers. Then he armed himself with royal armor and put on his armor. He wore gold and diamond rings on his fingers, crowned with a feather of the personified Nururangcha (Nokrangcha) bird. He put a golden royal crown (japi) on his head. Having thus purified himself by bathing in fragrant water drawn from several rivers, Swargadeo bathed Chomdau in the same manner with the fragrant water of the river. Then the king put on the bed gold jewelry, gold jewelry, gold and silver flowers, gold and silver water bowls, and pots and pans. He then offered flowers to Choshdev, wishing him long life. Then he dips the idol in three cups of water for bathing. Then he lit a candle in front of the golden idol. Then the king immediately spread a cloth around the room to cover the idol and took the idol and hung it around his neck with a gold necklace.

The harmony of various instruments played. The Ahom priests offered Assyrian gold and Assyrian silver as gifts to the king. Then they told the king moral and spiritual principles, and the king listened intently. The three nobles (Phukins) bowed down seven times and worshiped the king. Then the king offered many birds and animals to the gods and goddesses. Then the king came down from his throne and killed a mosquito with a golden stick. The three nobles also each killed an ox with a silver stick. Then there is a banquet and a joyous festival. Then Swargadeo rode on an elephant to the Chomdeo temple and restored the idol. Thus, the idols played a particularly important role in the inauguration ceremony. The &amp;#39;Harkant Barua Sadramin Buranji&amp;#39; says that &amp;#39;the custom of climbing the shingri house began in the days of &amp;#39;Chudangphar (Bamuni Konwar). The king had a &amp;#39;shingri house&amp;#39; built at Sargua for the coronation of the king. The house was made of shingri tree wood and painted and beautifully decorated. On the appointed day, ministers and officials arrived there wearing colorful robes and ornaments. The king and queen, after bathing and wearing royal robes, went to the throne with the Ahom priests Deodhai, Mohan and Bailung. Then the singers and dancers perform dances and songs, and the musicians play their instruments. The priests worship Landon and other Ahom gods and goddesses and bless the king.

There is also a detailed account of the coronation ceremony in the Tunkhungia Buranji. &amp;#39;On Friday morning, the third day of the month of Ahar (1667), His Majesty ascended to the house of Shingri. When it was four o&amp;#39;clock in the afternoon, the three ministers knelt before the king and gave him land in the designated place. Then the king ordered Maut Parmai to bring the elephant named &amp;#39;Sweet Melon&amp;#39; and tie a hawda on its back. From Tangkak, the Emperor set out to fetch the idol of Chengdeo. When he reached the temple with the idol, he got off the elephant and went to the altar and hung the idol around his neck. Returning to Tongkak, he went to a secluded room and sat down. The idol was still hanging around his neck. The throne was set on the north and south outside of the cloth. Three other wooden seats with poles carved with winged dragons or unicorns were placed facing the throne and flatter than on the north and south sides. The three seats were arranged in a row like a staircase to the north of the throne, and each seat was covered with a cloth. When the king ascended the throne, the Burhagoha took his position on the right and held the pillars on the east side. The Bargohai holds the western pillars and the Barpatra and Barbarua hold the southern pillars. Above the throne is another seat with an award carved in the form of a winged giant.

Then the king laid his hands on the head of the Burhagohai and ascended the throne. The Deodhai or Ahom priests chant the mantra again and the Swargade places the idol of Chengdeu in a designated place surrounded by a background cloth and leaves and sits on a balcony on the upper floor. Then the Baroua and the treasurer accepted the coconuts, rice, duck eggs, clothes, etc. given as gifts to the Emperor and prepared a list of them. After that work is done, the veil is removed and the three nobles, the Baroas and the Fukans, bow to the idol nine times. Then everyone came out and the three gentlemen took their seats in the royal assembly. They are treated to a feast at the Holonghar. At the end of the day, when there were two rods, the heavenly gods came and ascended the throne with nine beams. There are many different types of characters in the film.

Gordon saw a plaque in the shape of a metal base in the custody of Puranda Singh&amp;#39;s successor, Prince Chandra Narayan Singh of Jorhat Oblique but rounded above, measuring 9/,” 31/,” 1/,” thick. It was considered to be the altar of Chomdeu. There was a hole at the very top, which was used to hang the Ahom kings around their necks during their coronation. Colonel Gordon was told that Chomdeo was a gem in a cylinder and was sold by a nephew of His Majesty Purandar Singh in financial difficulties while in Calcutta. He was told that the same unfortunate incident occurred with seven gold saffrons arranged one by one inside a saffron, which previously contained a metal plate. The back, front and two sides of the table were engraved in Chinese script, such as the fifth year of Yung Lo (1408 BC) on the front; On the back, “By order of the Emperor, the president of the council compared the two unfinished ones”; on the left, “Be faithful,” and on the right, “May the diagnoses be effective; the royal commission of alliance with Timasa.” The back and front inscriptions are said to be complete but the side inscriptions are said to be incomplete, as the rest of the base is on another similar metal base which is traditionally preserved in the Chinese capital.

How the metal base came into the hands of the Ahom and why they kept it with them as a sacred idol remains an unsolved mystery. (Gait : 1984:74) However, the metal base is the Ahom kings The sacred idol can never be the basis of Chomdev. First of all, the Ahom were never the Kartalia kings of China; Secondly, the real Chomdeu was lost to the Ahom kings. Therefore, the basis is not ka with the idol of Choshdeu as according to Ahom religious scriptures, Choshdev was a &amp;#39;Jyotirmay Ratna&amp;#39; in the shape of an eagle.

<content>The Ahom religion is also known as Lankuri (Langkun), Khungkhura, Aijo Lao, Ahu Kuber and Ahu Lakhim. The southern part of the earth (Myengteo Myengtam) is known by the names of the main deities Shiva Shankar, Parvati, Shali Kubera, Shali Lakhim, etc. The gods of crops in both regions are traditionally worshiped by our Tai Ahom Assamese people. 218 The Tai Ahoms were agriculturalists. The concept of Lakhim or Lakshi Devi of the Tai Ahom is not more than 600 years old. Therefore, the concept of Lakhim Devi was absurd among the gods worshiped by the Tai Ahoms of the pre-Chu-Kapha period. In ancient times, the Tai Ahom had no fee or god who possessed rice and wealth. When the Tai Ahom arrived in Mukang or Munkrang, they worshiped the native gods Ai Jang-nao and Ni-jang-kham among their gods. This deity is mainly associated with the cultivation of oilseed rice. When the Tai Ahom entered the Brahmaputra Valley under the leadership of Chu-ka-pha, they met only the indigenous Barahi, Chutia and Maran-Mataks. The religion of this pre-Sanskrit community is mainly half Hindu and half tribal. This religious culture was also adopted by the Tai Ahom and they became among the indigenous people. They created a harmony. The Tai Ahom gave equal status to these indigenous gods and goddesses along with their own gods at a mixed level. There are many ways in which you can improve your self-confidence. There are many ways in which you can improve your self-confidence. The ancestors of the Ahom were Landon and Thenkham.

<content>Ahom Religion 211 Philareng is the two forms of the great mother, Aijanglao (ah) and Nijangkham (rice), the goddess of crops. Therefore, it is important to understand that the Ahoms believe that there are two people, As and Shali Kubei. Ahu Kubei is called Aijanglao and Shali Kubei is called Nijangkham. There is a khekari next to the barn and a matghar vegetable puja for Shali Kubeir. The Ahom believe that As Lakhim was the daughter of Marag and lived in the mountains; Shali Lakhim is believed to have been in the sea. The reason for bringing Lakhim from the sea or river is the god of juice, Khaokham or the god of water power, the owner of the waters and the sea is the place of juice power. They are the first to worship the god Khaokham because Lakhim lives in this sea. The songs or malitas of Lakhim Adara Puja beautifully reflect that the worshiped Lakhim Devi of the Ahoms is the daughter of Krunkhura or Badau Khura of the Maran community. For some unknown reason, the lucky woman was hiding in the sea or in the wide waters. The two men of the Tai Ahom went in a cultural environment and offered a part of the worship to the god Bao-Kham, the lord of the water. This process is almost like the Bik, Puban or Ayutola ceremony. The puja mantras (khao-kham smriti) are the same. Therefore, some Tai Ahom believe that it is a ceremony to revive the barn. Lakhim Devi is lifted from the water and placed in the village public place in the barn of ash and rice. As part of this puja, tables decorated with ripe banana dough are brought from each house in the village and placed in rows at the appropriate places. Then there is the part of Lakhim</content>

Ahom Religion - Jahingpha Vandana Jasingpha Vandana The worship and festivals of the Ahom are essential in all aspects. Jasingpha is like Saraswati. The basic principle of this Jasingpha is that she is the possessor of all qualitative knowledge. Jasingpha is given priority in literacy, factory knowledge, etc. Jahingpha is the goddess of all practical knowledge. Nothing can be done in the world without knowledge. The Ahom must remember Jahingphak especially during their festivals. Jahingpha is commemorated in works such as Furalung, Sam-yun Ka Rikkhan, Hafun Ka Rikkhan, Chitfun Ka Rikshan, Saipha, Umpha, Rikshan Myungkhan, Lungfai, Kangfai, etc. Therefore, Jahingpha is the right-hand man in human society.

<content>Ahom Religion 227 Singh. He later got another name, Jahingpha. She is the goddess of the development of all knowledge. It is believed that worship of him promotes the development of the human soul. The Jasingfa ceremony is conducted in the Ban-Fi manner. There are three types: one full stage, the other two non-ceremonial, full stage should be widely collected and delivered. For example, Umpha, Saifa, Rikmban, Mungkhan, Madam-me-phi, Hafun-ka ban phi, Phun lyng k ban phi! In all these ceremonies, the family deity Jasingpha is given a seat. Informal Jahingpha ceremonies Jahingpha ceremonies are held on Sundays at weddings, children&amp;#39;s cleansing ceremonies and new meals. Another ceremonial stage is when various Tai books, including religious books, are brought down from the shank to be copied, and the priests light candles and offer coconuts and drinks to the family deity Jasingpha just before studying. &amp;quot;Chao nu ru cha kao oi !

<content>She is the giver and mother of your tradition and knowledge carved with the Ahom religion. 228 Similarly, in the work of Furalung, Jasingpha is praised by singing: “Chao Nuru Chao Ka Ai. Chao Malik Malai Fa ka ru lai chaofa sing mu. Chao fa pen sing mung cho-sen mung ba seng tara. The meaning is the same as in the 1st. The three sentences are slightly different but they have the same meaning. Jasingfai is the first priest who created the divine great knowledge. The order of thirty generations “Mai-Ru” is the primordial wise priest! Then for fifty generations, great wise men, scribes and priests. Jasingphai is the creator of the first letter in the form of words and the goddess who possesses words. She is the giver of knowledge and the mother of doctrine. In Umpha Puja, Jasingpha is worshiped with three pairs of palm leaves, a tankak on the fun, three coconuts covered with chinkara flowers, three bags of lao, a coconut, one piece of offering, nine chickens, nine eggs and nine chickens separately. The mantra of the worship is almost the same. In Dam Puja, Jasingpha is covered with chinkara flowers on palm leaves</content>

The Ahom history mentions how Jasingpha was given priority by the heavenly king Landon. Jasingpha is regarded as a goddess in this description, although the Jasingpha praise songs mention not only Jasingpha but all the band gurus. In the Vandana Geet, the three Vandana Gurus are thus praised as one of the original Gurus, the Eight Gurus, IK Khen, IK Kham, I Song Singh, M-Laobri, Pujakji, Munti and Sengkham. But in this praise-song, these eight gurus are also praised as the gurus. The priests of the Tai Ahom, Deodhai, Mohan and Bailupta, worship Jahingpha, the goddess of knowledge, by killing chickens with chicken tails or bansengs to see Mars. To see the day and time of the puja, first worship Jahingpha</content>

<content>230 Ahom religion. It is the tradition of the Ahom kings to watch Mars with their chicken tails. Such Mars watching ceremonies and Jasingphak Puja were performed by almost every Swargadeva They look at Mars before doing any good deeds and when they look at Mars, they worship Jasingpha. Therefore, the Ahom priests also worship Jasingpha to open books and treasures. The next morning (the king of heaven) Landon summoned Chao Saifunnyai (the god of mist) and sent for Jasingpha, the goddess of knowledge. He rode to Jasingpha&amp;#39;s house. He got off his horse and saw Jasingpha cutting yarn with three hundred servants. Jasingfai looked at his face and asked the reason for his arrival. &amp;quot;Surely Heavenly King Landon has sent for you,&amp;quot; he said, looking at his face. Then he asked a servant to give him a tool to sit on. They laid a piece of wood on top of it. &amp;quot;Langdon has no family member to rule the world. He has no one to worship him. So he is thinking of sending someone from his family. He wants to send a member of his family to rule the world. That is why he has sent for me. Jasingfai did not delay any longer when the god of mist said it was true. He put on beautiful clothes. Choose the whole golden star. Then he put on a gold necklace. She also wore a flower of diamonds in her hair. His clothes are so bright that any animal will dazzle him.” From this description, it is clear that Jasingpha is a goddess.</content>

<content>Ahom Religion Habideo (Bird) Habideo is one of the three parts of Uma. The deities worshiped in this Habideo are: Lankuri, Nah-chi-chao Barchaman, Likha Shaman, Gatial, Khetar, Yakh, Bhut, and Bakhbaghini from the right hand respectively. The gods of this level are worshipped. These gods are worshiped by making a three-sided idol made of banana leaves according to Tai rituals. The rest of the Nang-chi-chao is given to the ground. Other Barsaman, Likhasyaman and Gatial are given three changs in turn. In addition, ghosts and tigers are placed on the ground. The rest of the yaks and fields are made into idols of banana leaves. In addition, the offerings are decorated with lankuri, nang-chi-chao, baraman and likhasaman kau leaves.

<content>The Ahom religion is Umpha according to the Kheklai ritual. This is because there are three temples in Umpha. There are many temples, especially Bardeoshal, Hindu temple and Habi temple. This is because only the demigods of the same level as Fa Nuru-Landon, including Fa Nuru-Landon, are remembered or worshiped in Saifa. There are many different types of ceremonies and rituals that are performed in the temple. The gods of the water (Khao-Kham), the lord of the earth (I-Leng-Din), the gods (Jan-Sai Hung), Fa-Nuru-Lendon, Chit-Lamsam, and especially the seven sons of Lengden, Mut Kum Ai Kum Jasingpha and Ra Khin. Jan Sai Hung and Fa Nubd Landon are worshiped with wine made from banana tree trunks. The rest of the gods, including Chit-Lam Sam and Jasingpha, are worshiped in an Ashlia-powered chang and the rest of the Khin gods are worshiped in a net on the ground at the same level. According to the Tai Ahom religious tradition, the Saifa ceremony is held with the Chit-Fun Karik, or seven-sided Mehenga. The offerings required for the Saifa ceremony or puja are triangular rice of bora rice (khaokhem), bora rice rice, (r khao) coconut with wells, chinkara flowers, maize, ripe bananas, raw bananas, raw sweets and akhai. In addition, Rahi Lao Thola is ceremonially decorated every Mehenga and three duck eggs are given to Khao Dham along with three ripe bananas and half a rice. The remaining mehengas are offered as mentioned earlier in stages: three chickens to I-leng-din, four to Dev Guru Jan-i-hung, four to Fanuru Landon, seven to Chit Lam Sam, two to Mrit-kum Tai Kum, two to Jasingpha, two to Ghai Dam and two to Ra Dhin Five are small</content>

<content>The Ahom religion is to give chickens. Ai Leng Din, Jansai Ho, Fa-Nuru Landon, Chit-Lam-Sam are given a pet pakhara or chila pig to Ai-Leng-Din, a white pig to Fa-Nuru Landon and a black pig to the other two respectively. This is inherent in the Khek Lai Puja ritual. In addition, the custom of giving charjari, or gold and silver chains, is mentioned in the Khek Lai Puja ritual. Therefore, this chain is given to the royal family or the subjects. 233 Ancient God Lankuri Tai The Ahom father Chao Lung Sukapha entered the country and established the kingdom of Myut Myung-Dun-Chun-Kham after suffering many hardships. They set up a city in Myung Zheu. First, the big old god (Khun-thao-nyeu) offered worship to Lankuri. He asked for blessings from Lankuri. A big big tree, said the scholars. The king, the Bargohai, the Budha-Gohai, and the Mosam-Mosai worshiped the gods. Lakni Myut-keu founded the city (che) in the year. He built a great golden city on a hill (Che-kham). He put red dogs on the north and south. He buried gold at the root of a tree. Then they worshiped the gods of the land and the kingdom. He settled in the big city of the mountains (Che-Sungche-Kham). This city of Che-rai-day became the capital city. He was the first to build a temple to the god Lankuri. Thus, we find the Lankuri Puja first introduced in our country by Swargadeo in the Sachipatia Tai-Ahom language. Chukapha Swargade introduced many Ahom pujas in Assam. He first held the Me-Dam-Me-Fi Puja in Tipam. Later, he came to Cherai-Doy (Charaideu) and established a tradition of worshiping the god Lankuri. his</content>

<content>234 Later, Umpha worshiped. In Umpha Puja, the seven main Ahom gods are worshiped at the Ahom Bardeoshal. They are Khaokham (water god), Jansaiing (teacher of heaven and earth), Fanu Ru Landon (lord of heaven and the symbol of Phra-Tuhing-Flam-Hum), Chitlam Cham (ruler of the seven zones), Mut-kum Tai Kum (moon-sun), Jahingpha (Goddess of Knowledge) and Radhin Ba-khin (demons, Rahu-Ketu-like). Moreover, the dams are given space. Another temple is the Habi Temple. These two shawls were established by Swargade Sukapha in Charideo. Chukapha worshiped the border guard gods in the second shawl. The main deities in this shawl were Lankuri (mountain god), Pa-fichu and Likha Chaman. The mantra by which Lankuri is worshiped at this place of worship is given below with its meaning: Chao Nuru Chao Oi! An nang chao kao oi. The Ahom religion is Khun Thao New Lankuri.

<content>The ancient god of the Ahom religion is Lankuri! Come with the gods and goddesses. You are the Creator of the great world and watch over everything. In ancient times, there was no one to rule. You were the one who ruled. You are the god of the vast mountains. You are the god of the mountains of gold and silver. You are the bearer of the trident. Your dwelling is on the snow-covered mountains in the north. O God above. I salute you. 235 The preparations for the Lankuri Puja in the Umpha-Saipha Puja contain information about the Budha Gosai Lankuri. The idol is made of palm leaves and has three ferrules. Each ferrule is tied with cow leaves like a trident and placed on the head. The idol is wrapped in the ground. Three jumps of cow-leaves are given in front. Sia coconut-pan (wrapped in flowers) is placed on the leaves. Three whole coconuts are tied with cotton and placed on the leaf. There are cut cakes, ripe bananas, cakes, chira, karai, betgaj; Sweet oil, salt and ginger are also kept. Three chickens, rahilao, salt and garlic are placed in the bag. A black pig is given. Lankuri is an ancient god, trident-bearer, inhabitant of snow-covered mountains, lord of animals. He is the god of the mountains. He is self-sufficient. The old-fashioned Ahom, especially the Mocham-Ma&amp;#39;cham and Maplong (Deodhai, Mohan, Bailung), worship Lankuri, Jan Sai Hung, Lareng, Landon and Jahingpha as the gurus of the clan in the month of Aghon (Dinching) in the New Year. Lankuri and Jan Sai Hung should be offered in the same fun (mehepta). Lankurik received three coconuts, three bags and three parts of rice, Jan Sai Hung received two coconuts, two bags and two parts of rice, Lareng received two coconuts, two bags and two parts of rice, Landon received four coconuts, four bags and four parts of rice and Jahiko is offered three chitkara flower coconuts, three bags, and three portions of rice.

<content>236 THE RELIGION OF THE AHOMS They chant sacred mantras. They conclude the puja with Aptang (invocation), Kin-tang (acceptance of worship), Jantang (blessing the host) and Boytang (farewell). The Ahom scholars regard Lankuri as the father of the plow and the supreme agricultural father-guru of the people and worship the time-form of Lankuri, the commander of wars and idols, at Umpha-Saipha. The Ahom kings worshiped Umpha and Saipha and also worshiped the god Lankuri. Among the kings, Chaopha Chupatpha (Gadadhar Singh) worshiped the god Lankuri himself. They also started offering worship to Hindu gods and goddesses by setting up Hindu halls for the Umpha-Saipha Puja. The Hindu temple also worships Lord Mahadev. Therefore, the Ahom do not consider Lankuri and Mahadev to be the same deity. In addition to being known as the father of agricultural culture and one of the gurus, Lankuri is not considered to be the commander of the time of warfare. The tradition of worshiping the god Lankuri has been going on since the days of Chao Lung Sukapha. It is noteworthy that the tradition of worshiping the god Lankuri was brought from the country of Myungmao Lung by His Majesty Sukapha. It is a Tai tradition. There is also a Ratikhawa community among the Ahom. They are called Barkhelias. Their satras are Kalasanghatir Checha, Bagher, Budbari, Katnipar, Kardeguria etc. One of the favorite disciples of Gopaldev was Ramai or Ramdev. This Ramdev is the grandson of Saru Krishnadev, the founder of the satra in Chaliha Barshe. Shukadeva and Sunandadeva are disciples of Ramadeva. The first Guruseva of this sect. This is called surrender. In Sharan, the Guru teaches certain rules and regulations.</content>

<content>The second stage is bhajan. Bhajan is the second presence of the devotee. They are also taught the rules of food and dress, lighting candles and lanterns in the Namghar, and the rules of eating and religious books. - Then there is the stage of devotees who eat one coconut, two coconuts, four coconuts. There are two parts - Agam and Nigam. They teach ripe rules and raw rules. There are instructions and names in the ripe section. In the raw part, people teach people how to do devotional service, how to pray to God. The post of Budha Bhakat or Gaon Burha The society appoints Budha Bhakat or Gaon Burha by allowing some of the devotees who have taken refuge and are able to follow the rules and regulations. A virtuous devotee is a devotee of the previous level of a saint. The position of Molung or Sadhu-Bura is the highest position. He is a full husband in religious ceremonies. These Molungs or sadhu-budhas can perform parachits without being Brahmins if the people wish. The devotees of Barkhelia are divided into three levels. Panchanamia is the first stage. This means that they take the five names of Janardana. They bow down to their feet. The uppermost level is the conscious devotee. They can pronounce the name Bata. They are the devotee&amp;#39;s heart. The third level is Kevali. The Kevali devotee reaches the Kevali stage only after passing the Karani, Digambari level, which is the highest level. In order to reach the Karni stage, the devotee must face difficult tests. The devotee was examined by a naked woman in a closed room. All devotees and sisters present in this dholghar should remain naked. They test the devotee by placing wine, meat and tempting food in the dholghar. When the devotee passes the test, he becomes the Karni stage. The devotee who passes the test is Karani.</content>

The only devotee is the devotee who has reached the final stage of devotion. There is no existence other than the existence of God.

The Ratikhawa community is not only among the Ahom, but also among the Miching and Kachari communities.

<content>The Tai-Ahom Pandits now worship the Pulin Puthaos as dams, especially on the occasions of Bohag Bihu and Magh Bihu. Paddy and rice are abundant in the month of Magh. Therefore, pitha-pana is also offered to the Tam Phis on the occasion of Magh Bihu. We have already mentioned that the god Yu is remembered with great devotion on the occasion of Aghon. Immediately after the remembrance of the gods, the upari-purusha dams are also commemorated with fulmaihang in the same place of the main house. In this case, the same formula is used in everyone&amp;#39;s house to remember (1) Na-Dam, (2) Ghai-Dam and (3) Chiren Dam. Recently deceased parents get the position of Na-Dam. There are many ways in which you can improve your self-confidence. There are many ways in which you can improve your self-confidence. Those above are symbolically remembered as &amp;#39;Chiren Dam&amp;#39;, up to the three generations who have already been paid. Thus, measures are taken to maintain the order of worship of the Dam-phis in a timely manner on the basis of a rotational model without allowing the number of dead and the queues to become long. In this running method, the new dam will replace the main dam as required and thus the main dam will replace it. Those who were previously in the Chiren position will be left to worship and Melani will be sought, ie those in the Chiren position will be left to associate with the Eternal Fura. Therefore, when a person dies, the Maluts say, &amp;quot;Leave hope for life and go with the dead</content>

<content>262 The new meal is blessed according to the ancient law. In this case, Ponsa does not immediately mention heaven or the soul&amp;#39;s liberation. In other words, there is no rule that the living interact with the deceased&amp;#39;s body immediately after death. Therefore, the Tai-Ahom tradition does not have the rule of severing ties through body donation like the Hindus. Instead, at the shraddha ceremony held within twenty days, the scholars formally place the departed soul of the deceased in the same row as the rest of the dam-phis inside and place it as the beauty of the house for future worship. Dam-Phi has a clear mantra for this. Relationships that exist during life are therefore believed to continue after death. It is therefore believed that the departed beings of the deceased seek worship from the living generation in due course. It is believed that the departed souls of the deceased have blessings for the living grandchildren if they are worshiped and respected in time and properly. Therefore, it is important to understand the importance of these issues in the development of the country. Therefore, it is important to understand the importance of these issues in the development of the country Therefore, the meaning of the Tai-language saying is as follows - “There is no one to keep the dead death of the thirteenth god house if you do not keep the wall ”etc. Dam Ki held on the occasion of new meals: Four to one of the households usually worship the uparis by giving maihang.

<content>There are also seasonal delicacies such as potatoes and rice. In the past, fish such as mackerel and crawfish were served in Maihang. Other fish are also given due to shortages. On the other hand, spinach-tepu is usually made into a soup of mackerel with kharichha. The soup is offered to Maihang with vegetables and rice. Any commodity of bora rice is given a mutually important place or recognition. Therefore, people offer Dam Deo before eating. On the occasion of Na-Khawa, many Mohan-Deodhai Bailung people cook rice served with bora rice and offer it to Dam Deo by mixing a little water with it and putting it in a bag in each part. Since water is not added to the garlic offered to the gods above, such as Landon, who are thought to reside in the kingdom of heaven, it is called “luk-lau” and the rest of the garlic is called “nam lau” or the only garlic. The rules are the same as the offering of blocks with the rest of the coconuts. The rules are the same as taking water in a pot or suitable container and purifying the substances with a block sangfar. After each chant, the offering of garlic is similar to that of Banfi. Similarly, it is the rule to chant mantras in three stages. (1) Aotang (2) Kin tang or Klintang (3) Jan-tang or Boytang. Here too, the rule of chanting the Dam Phi mantra in tune is Chang Nai Chao Nuru Chao Kao Oi Changnai Chaonuru Chao Kao Oi and so on. All members of the household should attend the ceremony if possible: although it is not possible for all members to be present at present, the main heads of the household should be present and the parents can take the coriander on behalf of those outside the household. In addition to education, jobs and good health for the new generation of bananas. You can appeal to him and seek his blessings accordingly. -</content>

<content>264 Na Khawa Festival At present, the Dam-phi Puja held on the occasion of Na Khawa may not be able to offer all the above items or may vary slightly. But it is usually essential to give kharikadia fish. “That is why it is said that I have given you kharikadia fish, it smells good, take it from wherever you are.” (In Tai language - Ham Ruru Hum Cha Cha ................) Thus, the names of all the objects are uttered in Tai language through mantras and pleadingly urged to accept them. Some people have to wait until the next Magh Bihu if they cannot offer Bora Lau, Barabhat, etc. to Dam-Deo on the occasion of Aghon Na-Khawa. This means that you can only eat it yourself after offering Dam-Phi on the occasion of Magh Bihu. It is usually the rule that the rice cooking pot and the dam-pata place are fixed on the floor of the same room. Therefore, the Dam-phis are remembered with Maihang and also offered to Ai Lakhim in the same way as Maihang or Dam-phis on leaves on the ground near the cooking fireplace. Separate mantras are also chanted for this purpose. This event is held only on the occasion of Na-Khawa, not on the rest of Bihu. This is how the Tai-Ahom priests have followed the ancient rules. Dam Phi ceremony on the occasion of Bihu: The Dam-phi ceremony on the occasion of Magh Bihu and Bohag Bihu is almost the same. There are some variations in the amount of cakes and drinks available from household to household. However, cooked wooden potatoes, jaggery, teldia pitha and tildia pitha are served during Magh Bihu. Wood potatoes are not offered during Bohag Bihu. Eating pork on the occasion of both these poisons has been a tradition. Therefore, some people also offer charred pork and fried pork to Maihang</content>

<content>265 does the feast of new eating. Blocksengfa uses it the same way. They also bless the householders for their well-being. Finally, the hosts and the deceased are satisfied with the Bihu garlic and jalpan. In addition, if the Dam-phi are displeased for any reason, or following the traditional rules, almost all the members of the Pandit&amp;#39;s household hold a ceremony to satisfy the Dam-phi by giving them a large chicken at an auspicious time of the year or on a predetermined day. This is called “Khen-Khau”. (Khen means time, khau means - rice). It also has a special mantra and it is essential that three Molungs are present at the ceremony. It is also customary to offer garlic to the dam-deo if the cow or bull is lost. This will bring the lost cattle back home. However, on the occasion of the loss of cattle, the Dam-phi must be appealed to. Similarly, when new seeds are sown in Jeth, when new land is harvested in Asar or Shaon, garlic must be wiped and cut in the dam-chuk and offered for Dam-fee. This is the rule of the past Otherwise, it means disobedience to Dam-Deo. Similarly, when someone goes on a long journey, he offers the Sukta Lau. When someone goes for an exam, an interview, or a groom goes to the bride&amp;#39;s house, he offers garlic at the dam-square and takes service. It is believed that if a pregnant bride can receive such services before the birth of her baby, obstacles will be removed. Thus it appears that, the beliefs and traditions of the Dam-Phi are deeply rooted in the lives of the priestly class. Moreover, it can be said that this belief has kept the lives of these people in order to a great extent. Other ceremonies such as the annual auspicious furalung also require the &amp;#39;damkjol&amp;#39; to be given to the dam chut. Then such programs will need to move forward. Otherwise, it is believed that such programs may not be fully meaningful.</content>

<content>266. The rule of giving the old chicken of the breeding as the new eating festival. The &amp;#39;Khen-Khao&amp;#39; ceremony is held very quietly even after the bride is taken out in case of difficulty. Sometimes the priest had to wait until the last night. Even if they are married as &amp;#39;chaklang&amp;#39;, the importance of &amp;#39;khenkhao&amp;#39; held for domestic dam-fee remains intact. It is believed that such a ceremony will ensure that the bride and groom will not have any difficulty on their way. It is also believed that if the bride and groom remember Damdev properly, their harmony and food life will continue into the future. It is believed that this strengthens the bond of harmony between the two houses (the bride and groom&amp;#39;s house) as well as the harmony of the two societies. It is believed that the society becomes prosperous with the blessings of the Upari-Pulin Puthaos. Therefore, it is important to understand the importance of these issues in the development of the country. Therefore, it is important to understand the importance of these issues in the development of the country. Since the departed souls of the Tai Ahom traditional dead are considered as housekeepers and auspicious beings, it is believed that their departed souls disappear in an awakened form and continue to shower blessings after death. Since the relationship with them is not severed in this sense, believers in the Tai-Ahom tradition, like Hindus, are not required to shave or shave their hair at the death of their parents or other close relatives. However, most people shave their heads out of blind imitation or already accustomed to Hindu traditions. On the other hand, it is not believed in the Tai-Ahom tradition that the deceased needs a &amp;#39;Puhak&amp;#39; after death for these reasons. It can be said to be associated with the dissatisfaction of the deceased. In the Tai Ahom tradition, the departed soul of the deceased is formally determined</content>

<content>It is believed that there is no room for the departed beings of these people to turn into an evil force, since they are recognized as a benevolent force through the rituals of the Na Khawa festival and promise to continue performing pujas and services during the Bihu of the year. There is no example of the departed soul of the deceased disappearing and causing misfortune to those who have followed their own traditions. However, the Tai tradition has rules about &amp;#39;imperfect human beings&amp;#39; Those who committed suicide for any reason or who remained unmarried are considered to be &amp;#39;imperfect beings&amp;#39; Such beings are sometimes thought to turn into evil forces and bring misfortune to someone&amp;#39;s family. These are called &amp;#39;Jakrua Dam&amp;#39; and to satisfy such beings, they are given a separate portion and bid farewell forever when the &amp;#39;Mara-lag-lagawa&amp;#39; ra na-purusha sakam is held in the family. In the past, almost everyone had a ladder to climb to the hut. Such &amp;#39;jarua prices&amp;#39; were said to be paid at the &amp;#39;mouth of the ladder&amp;#39; There is no changhar at present and it is customary to dedicate them in remote places. There are special mantras in Tai for this too. They take away some of the objects offered to the &amp;#39;been&amp;#39;, a symbol of evil forces, for the good of one of the scholars and throw them away. This is called &amp;#39;skinny-throwing&amp;#39; He is also paid appropriate remuneration for doing this work. After doing this, he went home far away without sitting with the rest of the Molungs. The Dam-phi belief is also closely associated with the Tai-Ahom funeral customs. In the Tai Ahom tradition, when a person dies, his body is buried.

<content>268 New Eating Festival There should be allowed to breathe his last in peace. There is no need to drag them out in a hurry or give them a disrespectful bed at the time of death, as in Hindu custom. Therefore, there is no need to fear that a person will become a ghost when he dies. Therefore, it is customary to keep the deceased in the place where he is and inform his family, friends and relatives in the village. After the arrival of relatives, the body is taken down from the bed and bathed at the main door of the house or in another suitable place. In this way, chicken eggs are broken on the forehead and the old clothes are changed into new ones. After that, a new table is laid in a suitable place in the courtyard, the body is covered with white cloth and incense is burned beside it. At the door, the bathing area of the deceased is thoroughly washed and cleaned hygienically with medicinal ingredients as necessary. Four poles are buried on the place where the body is placed in the courtyard and a small amount of palm leaves are given. The villagers have already started preparing bamboo rounddams. In this case, one can use a rungdam (hundred paras) of uriam wood if one wishes. In the absence of uriam wood, cham or mango wood can also be used to make rungdam. It is similar to the Sailak coffin but its characteristics differ from those of the coffin. On the other hand, rice is placed in a bowl on the ground at the feet of the deceased. Here, rice is made with as much rice as is available at once. (Earlier, it was customary for a close relative of the deceased to kill a small chicken by squeezing it with his left foot, but this has now been reformed.) Boiled eggs are also offered along with rice. They tie a coconut on the arms, veins and head of the deceased. In Assamese, the meaning of the Tai-language is sung as “Jile once bhat, die once bhat</content>

<content>270 The Molungs will bless him to forgive him for not eating. They will also appeal to the departed beings for eighty rains from an unseen place at all times. The Rungdam is then carried by the four on their shoulders and all present proceed to the burial place. The villagers have already gone in advance and made advance arrangements to prepare the grave wherever possible at the place shown by the host. The rungdam load is usually carried by the eldest son if he has his own son in front. If there are multiple sons, two sons are in front and other brothers-in-law are in the back. Other villagers and relatives also participate in the poverty. Some people leave their belongings with them at the grave, others donate them to others, and others keep them in their own homes. In the last period, if the bedding is very dirty due to illness or old age, it is burnt. When the funeral procession leaves the house of the deceased, a naked thread is thrown on the road to the grave. In other words, the bonds of earthly relationships have been symbolically broken! It is also customary to carry burning candles before the journey of the deceased. They also carry coconuts and beverages in a tome. When the grave is dug, the four turn three turns and place the body of the deceased with the head facing west on the ground below the grave with the rungdam. After the Molung and others present give the birth name, the householder gives the eldest son the first land plate if he is present first. Afterwards, all the relatives, along with all those present, lay soil on the grave. After the completion of the tomb, coconut seedlings and banana seedlings are planted. They also hang white cloths over the graves like a thatched roof. They also make bamboo birds and wooden horses as symbols</content>

<content>The new eating festival 271 is painted with bricks and placed in this house so that the departed being can rest temporarily until he finds a place in the house as a dam-fi. After that, mantra water is sprinkled on the people returning from the tomb. Similarly, for three days, the Tilni clan members call three Molungs from outside their clan to pour the oil and chant mantras in the Tai language and then apply it to the fingertips. The Mohan Deodhai-Bailungs can burn the naira in ten days and then perform a full shraddha a few days later. If someone wishes to celebrate a little more, the main ceremony is postponed for three months after the daha. There are many different types of ceremonies and rituals that are performed in the temple. It can also be held very informally if one does not want to or cannot afford it. The previous evening, the village elders are called and given the responsibility of the next day. This responsibility is distributed among the people. The host should only offer coconuts and appeal to the people to hand over the responsibility collectively. It is the ideal of the society or the characteristics of the equal-minded society of the primitive tribal ideals. Therefore, it is important to take into consideration the fact that the responsibility of the cooks is handed over to the cooks in front of the community on the previous day and the main cook digs the main stove of the kitchen on the same day. The next morning, the invited Moluts arrive and arrange the installation of the lock on the east side of the main rabha mandap or at the place shown by the host. If the host does not wish, the furalung is started by lighting eleven candles according to the instructions of the Social and Furalung Sangha. On the other hand, no</content>

<content>272. If a householder who is in a position to celebrate the shraddha of his father or mother wishes to celebrate the shraddha of his father or mother in a large and grand manner, he can also light a hundred and one candles with prior consultation and permission. All seasonal fruits, bananas, corn, manda and raw sweets can be offered in the sharai. If eleven candles are lit, eleven dons of palm oil are offered as offerings, four coconuts and coins. In addition, the host&amp;#39;s main cow-pan should be served in a large plate. In addition, the deceased must offer a sharai with cows, drinks and remuneration to establish and take the name of &amp;#39;Penjakaka&amp;#39; There is no remuneration obligation in this regard. If the host wishes, he can donate clothes for the deceased along with the remuneration. After the establishment of the Lak, the &amp;#39;Pen-ka-ka&amp;#39;, which is considered as the basic scripture of the Tai-Ahom, is established on the east side of the Lak by lighting a new gomocha, cow-pan, manni and lanterns. During the establishment of &amp;#39;Pen-kaka&amp;#39;, the Molungs give Janming as soon as the host takes service and appeals. After that, the three Molungs will take their seats facing Lak. These three, Mohan-Deodhai-Bailung, should be from all three households; Others can fill in the gaps. After that, three Molungs sitting facing Lak, ie facing east, will chant the mantra &amp;#39;Yiapulak&amp;#39; and prepare it. In front of the block sengpha flower, burn this &amp;#39;Ziapulak&amp;#39; and chant the mantra. All three Molungs will place their hands in the vessel of &amp;#39;Kriyapulakar&amp;#39; The action pulk is taken in two vessels. Water is mixed in one vessel and milk, ghee, honey, jaggery, sugar etc. in the other vessel, which is called Panchamrit in Assamese. Mantra - O phire fia orai ora na chao fura deck pin. and so on. ..... &amp;#39;Kriyapulaka&amp;#39; or &amp;#39;Kriyapulaka&amp;#39; which is purified after chanting three times</content>

<content>273 &amp;#39;Shandiyani&amp;#39; is first received by three Molungs and then given to the host as a servant in order as much as possible. Before taking the Panchamrita, it is the custom to take only the Naam-Kriyapulaka, the mantra-put drink taken in the first vessel, the Naam-Kriyapulaka. Then sprinkle the mantra water on the offerings and all the blocks of saffron and place them in their proper places around the lock. Immediately after the host places the candlestick placed on the lock, the others will light the remaining candles. After that, the servants will meditate collectively. After participating in Yiapulk and Aisinglau, the sevaki host can put jazzle in his mouth. The Molungs will then recite parts of the Lit-phat or Pen Kaka in tune and then chant the praises of the Supreme Creator with spiritual names in the Tai language. After three or four nam-sangs, the furalung concludes with applause. Chao Fura Chao Tara Fura-Tara Alang Oi and so on. There is also a temporary square shed of palm leaves in front of the banquet kitchen where three Molungs bless the pigs to be slaughtered as soon as the Furalung starts. After the molung sprinkles water with the cows and beans, if there is a suitable son-in-law, the son-in-law must kill the pig with a stick at the place already fixed. In the absence of a son-in-law, the pig is killed by an equal or non-local person. After that, if a relative offers a duck, etc., they must give cows and water and receive blessings. After this work is completed, the Molungs conclude the ceremony and go to the Furalung site.</content>

<content>274 Add new eating festivals. If the host wants to give garlic or dishes collectively, a few experienced people will take the garlic from the garlic pots offered by the host and soak it in a large pan with water so that everyone can share it. In the past, about an hour before the main meal, garlic was served in a bowl or leaf bag. This was called &amp;#39;chick-chak&amp;#39; in her language. This means eating light meals before the main meal. This system is now almost extinct. After accepting Kriyapul and purifying everyone, three Molungs were sent inside to build a dam in the corner of the inner dam from the Furalung place. They place the souls of the deceased as nine-dams on the right next to those who had previously occupied the place of ghaidam in the corner of the dam and appeal to the dam phis by chanting mantras. It is wished that the others will embrace the Na-Dam without any blame. In this ceremony, the host is the sevalaya. This is called &amp;#39;Dam-Chinwa&amp;#39; and from that day onwards, the deceased will be remembered according to rituals by paying respect as a house-jeuti at that place on Bihu and Sankranti. On the other hand, because of the public celebration, it was customary for the people to offer a pig&amp;#39;s pie for the Dam-Deos, but nowadays only a small amount of meat is offered and it is also offered as a sign of respect. 1 After the distribution of Furalung Mah-Prasad, everyone is invited to sit down for the main meal to eat in public and sometimes from 1200 to 1,000 well-wishing guests sit together in rows according to the dignity. There are many different types of dishes cooked by village cooks in agali leaves or banana leaves (today).</content>

<content>As soon as the new eating festival is completed, the hosts gather together, offer cows and drinks, and are blessed by those sitting in front of the seat and the elderly Molungs. Chao Fura Chao Tara Fura Tara Along Chikia Boy Mou Chau Kaoi. As soon as the blessing is completed, a molung with rice, vegetables, cows and water on a pair of leaves already goes around the rows (where possible) and throws the leaf away with respect. This is called &amp;#39;sea-flung&amp;#39; throwing. This means that the objects of nature are smoothly absorbed by the body and nature and the food offered by the host is digested like nectar without indigestion. They are also taken to prevent the evil forces of nature from causing any pain. On the other hand, almost all the rules and regulations of the Tai-Ahom tradition are scientific and useful for all times. At first glance, it appears that the shaving ritual is not in the Tai tradition. There is no rule of not wearing a robe with scissors, no rule of not sitting on a high seat, no rule of sleeping on straw. However, for ten days after death, the mind is kept in a sattvic manner, moving, sitting, eating and drinking. It is enough to maintain this mental discipline in the mind. She is not in the tradition of exaggerating with her appearance. On the other hand, since death is inevitable, she does not traditionally ask us to mourn too much. Instead, he is talking about restraint. Since the departed being is recognized as an awakened being after death and is always considered a benevolent force, it is believed to be humiliated by excessive mourning or acts of compassion. On the other hand, there is no place for Puhak in the Tai-Ahom tradition as the departed being of every deceased is considered as a benevolent being, so such rituals are not observed.</content>

<content>CHAPTER XI Rules and Regulations Related to the Burial Tradition The Ahom tradition of burial is still followed in many areas. The three clans of Mohan, Deodhai and Bailung are the priestly clans of the Ahom. In this case, the members of the priestly tribe follow this tradition. When an elderly man or woman who started a domestic life dies naturally, the family, relatives and neighbors of the deceased are immediately informed. As soon as the news of the deceased is received, relatives, relatives and neighbors come to the house of the deceased. These people are usually divided into three groups to conduct the funeral. A member of the first group hangs a sheet at the door of the barn. Some people take a bamboo from a tree, cut four poles from it, connect it with four knives, put three palm leaves on top of it and put a roof or rava three or four feet wide and six or seven feet long in the courtyard facing northeast. The rover&amp;#39;s floor is cut into pieces and cut into four corners of a board or board. While some members of the group perform the above activities, other members arrange to bathe the body of the deceased. This member is usually accompanied by a son, if a woman, a younger son. This is the work of the son</content>

<content>284 called Dharota with the tradition of giving a tomb. The person doing this work holds a pair of scissors in his hand. However, when he has to do something by hand, he scratches the scissors on his waist. The other members are usually peers in the relationship of the deceased. In the case of a person without sons, a relative whose relationship with the deceased is a nephew or brother or uncle. This bathing is done indoors. The body is lifted from the place where some members breathed their last and placed on a pira facing east. This area is usually near the main door of the house. After the body is placed in the pira, the worker breaks a chicken egg on the forehead of the deceased and pours the seeds from the forehead to the feet of the deceased. Then the body of the deceased is washed with water from an eva jar with amdali in the mouth filled with water. The bath water is not sent out through the door but through the wall (as until three or four decades ago most people did not have concrete houses, they had bamboo and thatch houses. Now, however, the policy has changed a bit). After bathing, the deceased is stripped of all his clothes and ornaments and put on white clothes from the waist down without dying. 1 As I mentioned earlier, a member of this group hangs a sheet at the door of the barn. He brings a piece of rice from the barn and folds a sheet over the rice dollar and puts three parts of rice in odd numbers in between. This dola is first placed under the rova in the courtyard and kept on the roof of the big house until the day of tilni before the body is taken out. It is believed that if a scholar finds something of the dollar of rice on the day of Tilni, it is considered a sign of misfortune. After the bath, the body is brought out of the house. The body is brought out and the head of the deceased is placed on a table under the cover of the courtyard</content>

<content>northeast and lower southwest. The rest of the body is covered with white cloth except the face. Relatives of the deceased can visit It is customary for relatives to offer incense and flowers during the funeral. After the last viewing, the body is covered with a white cloth and the ends of the cloth are wrapped in the left hand and placed under the body. After the above rituals are performed, the three main udhans are brought from the barghar, ie the kitchen, and placed on the right side of the deceased near the roof. However, if relatives and relatives of the village also bring rice, eggs, etc. to cook the rice, they are also cooked. These cooked ripenings are done by the scissors. A chicken is also killed by a scissors, burnt in the fire, the chicken&amp;#39;s esophagus is completely removed, a pair of banana leaves are placed on the maihang on the right side of the deceased and the chicken, rice and two boiled eggs are placed. In addition, two coconuts are given with chitkara flowers and two bags, these bags are given luk-lao or nam-lao. Similarly, under the maihang, a cheopat, a coconut with chinkara flowers, rice, an egg, and luk-lao or nam-lao are placed on a plate. This whole given task is handed over by the holder. Maihang means raw palm leaves cut into inches and placed on four bamboo poles like four pillars of the sea table. A ceiling of one square foot is placed on top of this pole. Luk-lao is to release water from the river, and Namlao is to give water to the river. Now Molung uttered the bike-word. She pronounces this bike-word in her language. The scissors shall serve at that time. In parallel with the work of the above group, the members of the second group carry out the chuchs, ie dead boxes or tunshodh or rangbhar ra chati</content>

<content>286 concentrate on making coffins with the tradition of tomb walls. They are usually made of four bamboo poles, similar to a wheelbarrow, but not like a ceiling like a wheelbarrow. The length and depth of the thief depends on the body shape of the deceased. Rangbhar consists of two bamboo or wooden poles but the two poles are not equal in size, they are unequal. Or the rods are given equal sizes back and forth so that the rangbharis do not have difficulty walking on the journey while carrying the loads. Now it is time to put the body in the tunkhong. On this mountain, before the body is placed in the tunkhong, four coconuts are placed on the body covered with cloth under the roof and the flower used is the kapat flower. Four coconuts are placed on one forehead, two on two arms and one on the navel. This is done before giving the coconut or the navel is cut. Navel cutting means that the white cloth wrapped around the navel of the deceased is filled with bamboo thread and tied with three female knots on the navel. After knotting, the remaining yarn is cut with a bamboo stick. The rest of the yarn is thrown on the roof of the house along with the shalar. This navel-cutting symbolizes the breaking of the relationship between the living and the deceased while they are alive, paving the way for a new relationship between the living and the dam. After the navel is cut, the body is ready to be placed in the Rangbhar. Now the jar used to wash the body is washed by sprinkling water from front to back with amdali. After the body is filled, two-story bow-shaped circular bamboo kami is placed on top of the rangbhar. This is called Kamik Chitika. Care is taken to ensure that the cloth does not fall off while carrying the rangbhar. This cloth is called morseoba. Although tradition requires that all the items used by a person be placed in the grave with the deceased after his death</content>

<content>The customs prevalent among the Mohans, Dewais and Bailuts at present are as follows: During the journey of the sha, the person who holds the scissors with the sha does not leave the shabhar, but carries a load using the stalk of a core as a kazmari. This load is filled with a coconut tree seedling, a palm tree ball, a bamboo khutong or tomat with the food items on the maihang, leaf bags, leaf bags given away, etc. In addition, use as a morseor A bung (garland) is made from a previously torn section of the cloth. Bamboo sticks are used to sew the bags. The bag carries symbolic gold and silver. They are used to cut raw garlic cloves as soap and the decorative ra part of the partydai tree as money. They also take the Bharat Maihang. This India also takes away the dishes, bowls, pots, pans, knives, piras, etc. used by the deceased. · In addition, the carrier of the load takes with him a burning sun. The third group also conducts the excavation of the grave along with the two tasks from bringing the dead out to the rangbhar and from making the mukhong to filling the body. The piece of land to be used for digging the hole must be bought from the landlord, Islanddin, with a cow-pan, with a contribution. In the past, coins were used as contributions but nowadays stolen money is used. When the land is bought, the gurapan is offered by another son of the deceased, ie, by someone other than the scissors, or by someone for the sake of the descendants. After completion of the purchase, the group members #fits a seven-foot-long, four-foot-deep one</content>

<content>Once the grave is completed, the body is taken for burial. The body is beaten before the procession begins. Now the question is, what is a penguin? And why is it done? Beating a chicken means that a priest, who is not of the same family as the deceased, will kill the chicken on the shoulder of the deceased and after death he will rub one tail of the chicken on one shoulder of the deceased They put the rest in a secluded place. This beating signifies that the deceased has broken his relationship with the living from today and that a new relationship between the living and the dam has been formed. The victim&amp;#39;s family offered a cow and pan to the people and received blessings from the people. Then the sons and descendants take turns carrying the body to the cemetery. At the very beginning of this journey, the worker carries the load mentioned earlier and carries Usha with Jor and Evasuta in his hand. They were rescued and the yarn was torn on the way. It also means a breakdown of relationships. The rest of the people used to put all the items he used inside the grave, but now they bury or burn the beds, clothes, blankets, blankets, etc. in separate holes. As soon as the funeral procession begins, the main wall of the char house is closed. This door is closed and a shawl is hung on the door of the barn so that Lakshmi Ai cannot go with him and his relationship with the house is severed. When the funeral procession reaches the cemetery, they make three turns around the hole while carrying the bangvar on their shoulders, lower the ravar from their shoulders in a convenient place in the car of the pit, wash the hole with water from the jar</content>

<content>Sailam fills it with the tradition of Jindah. At this point it doesn’t matter if the coffin is wooden; If it is bamboo instead of wood, wood or bamboo is laid at the bottom of the hole and on both sides. In addition, after the body is buried, wood and bamboo are laid on it. The coffin is then laid with wood, bamboo, etc. that accompanied the deceased, and the scissors places on it the bags of gold and silver, the daily use of the deceased, the knives, the bowls, etc. The scissors holder takes a piece of clay in his first hand. The soil flat taken by the cutter is the flat soil that came out when the first song was dug.

<content>312 floods are calculated. This book states that if the bride and groom are seen back to back, they are determined to be unmarried. If the two are face to face, they may not be legally paired according to their naming. Moreover, if the zodiac signs are the same in the case of the two namings, they are conjoined (paired). If the bride and groom are pictured walking from one front to the other. Therefore, there is no marriage (couple). Similarly, although mentioned above, in the three cases of birth, death and marriage, the auspicious days, birth and death charts of all the births, deaths and marriages can be determined in the above mentioned Fe Lung Fe Ban and Din-Ka Na. The Tai Ahom have a calculation of the 60-year cycle which is consistent with the calculation of Burma. It is said that this method of calculation was named after Khun Lai&amp;#39;s son Izep. This is called IJP lucky. The importance of I Jep Lakli is that it determines a historical year of Khunlung-Khunlai&amp;#39;s arrival at Murimuram. The Ijep Lakni gives us a glimpse of the year in which King Ijep ascended the throne. The Brahmadeshi count of Burma begins with the accession of this IJP king. Meanwhile, Ahom scholars have calculated that Chukapha entered Assam only after breaking 11 Tao from the arrival of Khulung-Khunlai. If we subtract 11 Taotinga, or 660 years, from 1228, we get King Ijep (a. Aidep-that-pha) became king of Murimuram 70 years after Khulung-Khunlai&amp;#39;s arrival in Murimuram. Therefore, there is no doubt that (568+70=) the national era of Burma began in 638 AD. From here we entered Muri-Muram and began the arrival of the brotherhood on earth</content>

<content>Banseng Method 12. People born in the month of Din Sip Song should overcome their troubles. Females are best slaughtered in the field alleys. 319 , According to Tai Ahom astrology, two astrologers in the sky, Kham Myung and Tunkham, are of particular importance. Astronomers include Naga Stars, Small Elephant Stars, Umbrella Stars, Elephant Enclose Stars, Horse Stars, Fan Stars, Heap of Rock Stars, Sky Stars Sky Shield Stars, Boat Tail Stars, The morning Statr, Pig Chin Stars, Revolving Stars, Spirit Stars, Ming Kham Stars, Four Corners Stars, Khap Pha Star, Shield Stars, Falling Stars, Khen Stars, Wang Stars, Pig Pen Stars, Tiger Stars, Stars of Fame, Rainbow Stars, The Lord Stars, Middle House Stars (Middle House), Basket Stars, Tip of the Umbrella Stars and so on. The fate of man depends on the presence of these stars. Three ancient Tai Ahom books describe in detail the benefits of the presence of various stars and the measures to be taken to remove evil flowers. Tai Ahom scholars can calculate the positions of such planets and stars and take timely action. Behind these timely measures lies the religious system of the Tai Ahom.</content>

<content>Basse Padma Thai scholars Ranu Uhsachin and Tariel have made an important contribution by translating three astrological texts from Ahom Tai into Thai and English. They have collected three astrological scriptures from various places and presented their translations to the intelligent community. Their book is called “Tai Ahom and Stars ”. &amp;gt; 20 From the translated astrological texts we learn how the Ahom kings determined their fortunes based on the positions of various stars. For example, when Kham Mu falls in line with the Naga star, when Kham-Mu falls in line with the Small Elephant Constellation, with the Chatra-mukhi Star, or with the Mattress Star, or with the Stone Cluster Star, or with the Sky Star When it falls on the line, it is bad for the country, the king and the people. For example, Kham-Mu was in the tail of the serpent (Laka) in the 26th year of the star cycle. Chao Chuhut Mung died that year. In the 27th year, the star Kham-Mu was located on the back of the serpent. In the 28 th year it was situated on a small elephant. In the 29th year, Mage stood in front of the star for a moment and then found the face of the star. In the 30th year, Kham Mu was located near the pig-covered star for the idol and later approached the elephant-covered star, and in the same year King Chao Chua-yun died. In the 31st year of the cycle, when the Kham-Mu star approaches the Bichini star, there is misfortune. If the Kham-Mu star is located near the pig (face) star in the 32nd year, it is still bad. If Kham-Mu is located on Tari - Nez Tara in the 33rd birth year, it is also bad. If two Chatras are located between stars in the 34th year of the cycle, it is bad or ominous. If the Moon passes through the elephant star in the 59th year of the cycle, it is auspicious. If the pig</content>

<content>When the moon enters the stars, there is a devastating war in the land. If the star rises in the west, the king dies in his palace. If the three-tailed star rises in the west, the king dies. If it rises in the south, there is war or quarreling and deadly fighting throughout the country. If the former arises, then the country is destroyed and the expansion of the army is damaged. If it rises in the north, then there is war throughout the kingdom. Then the moon enters the elephant stars,then the king is unhappy. If the Kham-Mu star is under the mouth of the serpent, the king is unhappy in that year. If Kham-mu star approaches elephant covered star then the king is unhappy. The Ahom scholars call the large star that rises in the early hours of the night Puvati Tara. When the star appears in the west, the larger star is called the Tungkham star. The translators of these three books accepted Kham Mung as very important in Ahom astrology and associated it with the Ras of Hindu astrology. The position of the most influential Kham-Mung in Ahom astrology determines the destiny of a person. The Ahom scholars believe that association with Kham-Mu snake, small elephant star, Chatra face star, elephant cover star, mattress star, and stone star brings bad results. These three books mention that the presence of Kham-yukh (arm) had a particularly ominous effect during the Ahom period. However, these books provide many ways to neutralize or reduce the egg effects of such conditions. All healing methods involve the worship of the gods. Building houses for Lakni and Ram Mung is one of these ways. It is also stated in these three texts that the motions of Lakni and Tham-myung are always opposite.</content>

<content>322 Ban The gods who thus spoke of the cycle of the yathi year in one of these three books prescribed a cycle of sixty years;prescribed the kham-myung. The chakra is called pan. Another chakra is the Han. It spreads from heaven to earth. Therefore, the Tai Ahom consider the stick-year cycle to be a gift from God. The translators also say: Kham-myung is not just the position of a planet or a planet (Rahu), it is an event. The Kham-Myung cycle, which moves against luck, is of great importance; This is because the presence of Kham Myung determines one&amp;#39;s fate. In short, among the four constants of the Ahom, Lakni, Kham-myung, Pi Pan and Pi-han are the basic numbers and positions. Laka or Narg is an important constant in Ahom astrology. The fate of a person is determined by the status of the Laka or Nagar. The position of the snake or Laka is written in astrology as follows: Dinching Dinkam, in the month of Disham, the tail of the snake is on the south and the stomach is on the east. The back is to the west. If the house is built and touched by the idol, the householder dies. If it hits the back, the first wife dies. Similarly, in the month of Dinshi, Dinha and Dik, the head (laka) is facing east; the tail is facing west and the abdomen is facing south; The back is to the north. If you take the house, it is better to put three pieces of meat on the stove and put it in three directions. Similarly, in Dinshi, Dipet, Dikau Laka, the head is to the south, the tail to the north and the back to the east. The abdomen is on the west side. If you take the house, it is auspicious to put three fish in the west in three directions</content>

<content>That is, Din Sip, Din Sip Eit, in the month of Din Si Posong, the head is on the west, the neck is on the east, the stomach is on the north and the back is on the south. If you take a house, it is better to put a small chicken in the front of the house. She consulted the scholars (the Molungs) about the location of the laka while the tribe was building their houses and raised the pillars of the houses. This will prevent any harm in the new house.

<content>The Rik Khan or Khan Ming ceremony is one of the most important national ceremonies of the Ahom people. This event is organized to empower one or more individuals or a country or nation. The Tai Ahom believe that many &amp;#39;khans&amp;#39; are associated with a person, which keeps him healthy and full of vitality. When a person falls into water or suffers from a serious illness, panics or suffers from depression or fear of severe force, or suddenly becomes restless and tired, that person loses some &amp;#39;khun&amp;#39; There are many descriptions of &amp;#39;rik-khan&amp;#39; or life-giving ceremonies in Ahom history. According to folk belief, the &amp;#39;khans&amp;#39; released from the body and mind of a person in such states go to rivers, seas, forests, mountains, tall trees, fruit trees like oranges, etc., and take refuge in the sky. The Ahom celebrate the &amp;#39;Khun&amp;#39; Ming&amp;#39; or &amp;#39;Rik Khan&amp;#39; ceremony with the aim of bringing back these abandoned &amp;#39;Khuns&amp;#39; During the reign of the Ahom kings, the &amp;#39;Rikkhan,&amp;#39; or &amp;#39;Khanming&amp;#39; ceremony was celebrated with royal pomp before the army left for battle, after its return from battle and during the coronation of the prince. The royal priests also performed this ceremony to gather the people to fight against the enemy and to strengthen the king before his coronation</content>

<content>328 Visvan or Khun Ming (lifting of life) was celebrated. This program attempts to bring back the &amp;#39;Khans who have left their body and mind and taken refuge in the splendor of nature. Lost &amp;#39;khans&amp;#39; are called &amp;#39;khantuks&amp;#39; (in humans). In the case of individuals, the ceremony celebrated to save the blood is called &amp;#39;Ao Rin Ming&amp;#39; or &amp;#39;Khunming&amp;#39; or &amp;#39;Rik Khun&amp;#39; In the case of the country or nation, this revival ceremony is called &amp;#39;Rik-khun Myung&amp;#39; The &amp;#39;Rik Khan&amp;#39; or &amp;#39;Khun Ming&amp;#39; ceremony is an essential part of the Ahom wedding ceremony &amp;#39;Chaklang&amp;#39; The &amp;#39;Khun Ming&amp;#39; ceremony is held two days before the wedding to wish the bride and groom good health. Rik literally means &amp;#39;call or invoke&amp;#39; and &amp;#39;khun&amp;#39; means &amp;#39;longevity or revival&amp;#39;.” The ritual performed for the welfare of the people of the state was called “Bishan Myungkhunban”. The ritual is usually not held after Kali Puja, ie during the dry season, as there is a shortage of water for this ritual The Ahom history records that the Ahom princes celebrated the &amp;#39;Rikshan&amp;#39; ceremony during the coronation of new kings, military victories or possible danger When King Landon sent his grandsons Khun Lung and Khun Lai to rule the earth, he said, &amp;#39;There are different communities in the earth</content>

<content>Viswan or Khun Ming (Ayu Tola) lives , you must rule with a stern hand. If a man rob his mother, or if an older brother takes his younger brother&amp;#39;s wife; No one should look at him, and if a person encounters such a sinner, he should immediately look up to heaven. If a wicked man rapes his daughter-in-law or his brother-in-law, he shall be stabbed in the liver. You should not look at such sinners. They should not be executed but sent to the deep forest full of tigers and bears. If you want to correct them, gather all the people, sacrifice ten cows and tell Landon. All the holy things must be gathered there. There must be a &amp;#39;chomdeo&amp;#39; The criminals must kneel before the god of heaven (the king). They must slaughter cattle and prepare a feast. You have to offer gifts to everyone. Some of the water washed by Chomdeu must be given to the criminals to drink. Then such people have to celebrate the &amp;#39;Rick Khan&amp;#39; ceremony. Then such people should be stripped of their clothes and allowed to go naked. (Ahom Buranji 1930, Guwahati, pp. 15-17) 329 ..... There are many references in Ahom history to the celebration of &amp;#39;Rikshon&amp;#39; as a national occasion by the Ahom kings. Chao Lung Chu-ka-fai was the first to celebrate the Rik Khan ceremony. He was the first to grant royal status to the ceremony to appease his god Landon and other gods. DHAS manuscript No. 2 Folio 6 (v) states that when Chu-ka-fai sent some gifts to Chu-khan Fa, king of Mu Maolung (Big Nara) and son of his uncle, Chao-sung Chu-Khan-Frayo is mutually friendly</content>

<content>A horse, its jeans, reins, etc., a golden hat with colored folds, a long robe decorated with gold and pearls hanging from front and back, a cloth embroidered with gold and thread, a large cloth with red stripes, and a wooden one Tool, a golden tool and a pair of golden socks sent Rick to the ceremony organized by Chu-Ka-Fai. Except that the objects of worship offered to the water god Khao Kham are offered on the ground, the objects dedicated to Ai Leng Din Sairepha Langdon and Jahingpha are arranged on a high altar. The offerings during the reign of the Ahom kings included cattle, cash, precious gems, clothing, etc. 330 According to Tai Ahom folklore, even at the time of death, the khuns that accompany a person should remain in their proper form. Therefore, after the death of a Chao Far (Ahom King Rajeshwar Singh), when the priests learned by divine power that the king had lost his &amp;#39;Khun&amp;#39;, the &amp;#39;Rik Khun&amp;#39; ceremony was celebrated to increase the strength of the king. They are not buried in the tomb according to the Ahom tradition. As a result, many unfortunate incidents occurred in the state and continued to lead to unfortunate consequences. This incident forced them to study marine science books and as a result they had to celebrate the &amp;#39;Rickshaw&amp;#39; event. For this purpose, the Ahom scholars advised the new king to make a statue of the dead king out of sandalwood. Therefore, it is necessary to take into consideration the following factors: He was buried in the graveyard after a rickshaw ceremony was held at Katman Hill.</content>

<content>The Biswan or Khun Ming (Ayu Tola) &amp;#39;Kangfai&amp;#39; (in handwriting) contains detailed descriptions of the rituals of the &amp;#39;Rik Khan&amp;#39; ceremony celebrated collectively and individually. This scripture says that &amp;#39;Khuns can leave a person&amp;#39;s body and live in big trees. If a person is panicked, his &amp;#39;blood&amp;#39; may leave him and take up residence at the entrance to the village. When the priests perform this ritual and invoke, the departed murderers return and settle in the person&amp;#39;s body. Another scripture that details this ceremony is the Bar-fai. The Bar-fai mentions three gods. They are Jansaihung, Fa Nuru-Langdon and Jaxing-Fa. The Lakhim festival is also celebrated according to the rules prescribed by the &amp;#39;Bar-fai&amp;#39; The Lakhim festival is also celebrated according to the rules of the &amp;#39;Lakhim&amp;#39; ceremony. According to the rituals of the &amp;#39;Lakhimi&amp;#39; ceremony, when water is brought from the river, and when Lakhimi is lifted from the water with a bamboo stick, the ceremony takes the form of a small rik khan ceremony. In such Lakhim festivals, women continuously perform Lakhim music. There are three ways in which the &amp;#39;Khun-Ming&amp;#39; or Rik Khan ceremony is celebrated. (1) Sarufai (Fai Noi) (2) Maju Fai (Fai Kang) (3) Bar Fai (Fai Lung) The details are given below. 331 Saru Fai (Fai Nai): Saru Fai is held on the occasion of a wedding ceremony (chakklang) or when someone&amp;#39;s khun is released (or lost). The small fai method does not decorate the &amp;#39;mehenga&amp;#39; (raised bamboo balls). Two sails are required to follow this method. Two or three priests (molung) are required for this ceremony.

Then, in the same way, the rule of returning the murdered person (jan-ming) is the same. The priests fish in the same way. The fish caught in the sack is cooked and fed to the person with heart health. Bar-fai: The method of fishing and recovering lost blood is similar to that of Sarufai and Maju-fai. Chickens are slaughtered here by chanting the mantra &amp;#39;Tham-Tang&amp;#39; The stomachs of the chickens that die in this way are cut off, burned in the fire and then offered on the altar. The chickens are fed eggs, rice, raw bananas, ripe bananas, soft rice (khao r), sweet pitha-pana and rice bags. A &amp;#39;megela&amp;#39;, a tree trunk, is used to purify water and chant mantras. The &amp;#39;Bor Fai Puthi&amp;#39; was read at the function. &amp;quot;</content>

<content>Biswan or Khun Ming (Ayu Tola) is cooked and fed to family members before sunrise. The next morning, the priests chant mantras and observe the tails of the slaughtered chickens to see the future well-being of the family. The first mention of the murder ceremony in manuscripts is as follows. 339 For six years Chu-ka-fai ruled from Khen-tun-zao, Tun Zhao (Shimla). Then he went to the Ti-mak River. He founded the city of Lang-tao-fa at Lakni Rai Mit. He opened new paddy fields. Then there he celebrated the Rick Khan ceremony. (History and Archaeology Department, Book No. 2, p. 2(a), Book No. 34, p. 10(b), BK Gohain Collected Book, p. 10(b) The Ahom History mentions that after the defeat of the Chutia in 1552 AD Another Rik Khun ceremony was celebrated with royal dignity during the reign of the mountain king Chu-Dai in 1678. The Khun and Chau (mind or heart) are closely related every day of the month They are located in different parts of the body on the first day of the month, in the soles of the feet, in the upper legs on the third day, in the waist on the fourth day and in the fifth day There is blood in the mouth on the sixth day, blood in the lower back, blood in the lower back on the eighth day, blood in the arms on the ninth day Look at it during the day</content>

In twenty-eight days, Chau is in the veins and eyebrows, and Shan is in the nose. On the thirty-ninth day, there is tea in the hair and blood on the forehead. On the thirtieth day, there is chau on the ankle and blood in front of the hair. Another manuscript (Lik Hongkhan) says, &amp;quot;Come, come, thirty murderers who live in human bodies. Come, ninety murderers. I have infused life into the body of your patron for a thousand years. You murderers, revered by the ears and eyes, stay with your master.”” (Book No. 1816, 2678 pp. 12-13: Ye Hum Buragohain) :</content>

<content>Viswan or Khunming (life span) From the above description it is evident that the eyes and sight are the main sensory senses of the human body which is constantly affected by the sight of beautiful seas, rivers, streams, lakes, flowers, oranges and other sweet fruits. 083 The Shan male books are written in almost the same words among the Aitan, Kake and Khamyang. There are two kinds of murder rules among them. (1) They call at home. (2) They take a boat and go to the banks of rivers or ponds. The patient goes to the place where the murderer is lost in fear and calls the murderer. When a person has been suffering from illness for a long time, then Vishvan is held. When reading the loan book for Rikhan, prepare as follows : Clean the stove very well first. Unbroken rice (hai-thao-mo&amp;#39; is placed on it. Unbroken and broken rice in new cloth is placed inside the hai thao. Three people are around the stove. A basket of brown rice, cooked rice, meat, fish, eggs or potatoes The door on the south side will be closed and the door on the north side will be opened. If the rice is not broken, it is considered to be murder, and if it is not broken, then the man (Pandit) reads the book again, and if it does not come, he reads it seven times and takes the hanger in his hand</content>

They put the egg yolk on the sick person&amp;#39;s forehead and read the book &amp;#39;Khun&amp;#39; and say &amp;#39;Ji-jap&amp;#39; three times. Then the offerings are distributed among the devotees and guests This is how the &amp;#39;Khun&amp;#39; Puja is celebrated. Murder is the life force of man. This murderer is a beauty lover. It is an unstoppable form of energy. This is the first time that the Tai Ahom have loved beauty. References: &amp;gt;) Department of History and Archaeology, Book No. 2, p. K.S. 10.

<content>Chapter Fifteen The Story of the Buddhist Jataka in the Tai-Ahom Language The Buddhist Jataka is found in the form of sealed books among the Tai-Ahom scriptures. These books record the story of the Buddha&amp;#39;s previous birth. These rebirth stories are in the Ahom language and many people try to say that the Ahom were Buddhists. Since the Tai language books of Jataka stories are not kept or read as religious scriptures in any puja, we think that these Jataka stories were brought by the newly arrived Tai Khans after the arrival of Chu-ka-pha with their daughters married by the Ahom kings. These Jataka stories show the belief in reincarnation. However, the Ahom did not believe in reincarnation in the beginning. Therefore, these scriptures are written in the Ahom-Tai language but are outside the Ahom thought. To show what is written in these charts, the Assamese translations of the two charts, Nemi Mang Phura and Urak Fla Kla, are given below. In the past, when the Lord rested in a kingdom called Mithila, Clare preached his religion among the people of Mithila.</content>

<content>He preached the Buddhist Jatak Kahin in the Bhai-Ahom language. When Frau preached, the kingdom of Mithila was flourishing; All the flowers in every corner of the country were fighting with their fragrant flowers. The flowers opened and blossomed because the Lord (Frye) preached the principle of non-violence. (Fra) When the Lord preached, the creatures and gods of the world listened intently to the words that came out of His mouth. The words of righteousness that came out of the mouth of the Lord (Tra) made the whole land blossom like a bunch of flowers. While sitting on the golden throne, Frare was surrounded by three disciples. The three disciples were wise men. They prayed to God and asked him many questions. There was a wise and learned great disciple named Charipua, who was on the right side of Clar; He preached the religion among gods, humans and all living beings at the behest of Clar and spread happiness and peace to all living beings in the world through the principle of non-violence. His heart was soft and clean as white cotton ; He treated all animals equally. They were above men and gods. Another woman named Maghalana was the chief disciple. He always sat on the left side of God. He listened intently to the words and advice from the mouth of the Lord and gained much knowledge. He preached advice and words beautifully among all men and gods, and showed the way of salvation to the creatures of the world. Then there was Clar&amp;#39;s brother named Chao Anand. He sat in front of Lord Kla as a Shiva. He listened to all the words of the Lord and remembered all the customs and ate them. He can be said to be the second incarnation after God. After the Lord Fra, His words (Bra) and the teachings of the Dharma, the means of attaining Nirvana, the service of the world, the preaching of the Dharma preached by Him twelve times among the human race, will be extinguished</content>

<content>086 Bhai-Ahom language Buddhist birth story aroused respect in everyone&amp;#39;s hearts. Ananda saw Lord Frak smiling and began to plead and ask him (see Kauri) that is, O Lord, merciful, what are you seeing that you are smiling like this? Would you please let me know? Then Lord Fry began to speak ; As soon as he opened his mouth, he saw the whole world shining green inside his mouth. Fry explained to his brother Anand that all the gods and people in this kingdom of Mithila were beautiful to look at. The mango orchards and flower gardens in the state of Mithila are so spacious and so beautiful. There is nothing wrong with that. The smell of flowers is spreading all over the country. Thousands of flower petals were filled with fragrance. When the monks pray to Lord Fra, Lord refers to his brother Anand and Anand understands everything by his spiritual power. Everything seemed to float before his eyes. Ananda asked the Lord, &amp;quot;Please explain to me how the people and gods (Fikon) on earth became beautiful and famous. The Lord knew everything about the past and the future. So he began to tell Ananda about the kingdom of Mithila There are many ways in which you can improve your self-confidence. There are many ways in which you can improve your self-confidence After receiving supreme knowledge from penance, he sits on the golden lion and attains divinity as other incarnations have passed through in the past</content>

<content>In the year of the Buddhist caste in the Tai-Ahom language, the Lord went to the forest and began to perform penance following the customs of the ancients who had passed away. In other words, the Lord went to a rock cave in the forest to sit on a rock and perform severe penance for many years. He was not the king of his vast country but gave up everything and went to seek the path to Nirvana or liberation and engaged in penance in a cave. That Frye attained Nivana only after eight thousand four thousand years. Attaining Nirvana means a happy state at the top of the sky without any suffering, worry, pain or meaninglessness. Every incarnation lives on earth in the same way with the same principles. No one can do harm when he sits on the golden throne of Nivana; There are no enemies. Fly explained to Anand, &amp;#39;Once upon a time there was a king named Nemimao. He was an incarnation of God. At that time, Nemimang Konwar became king over all the gods and people throughout the country. He preached religion among the creatures of the world and showed them the way of religion. He showed all people the path to Nirvana by following the principles of the previous incarnations of the Lord. The prince was young and did not know much; He preached with his limited knowledge. His knowledge did not reach the sun in the sky; Yet his knowledge was as bright as the sun, but it was not complete because he was small. The Lord told His disciples, the monks holding mattresses in their hands who took the name of the Lord in a condom, that the prince Nemima whom I have told you will become an incarnation of a Lord in the future; That is why (Chaufate) Vajradata and Landon have always raised him. One day, while Nemimang was doing this, he decided to do penance. He did not want to be king. One day he went to the Lord and said, &amp;#39;I want to do penance. 089</content>

<content>He knew that his wife was getting older. Gradually, his black hair appeared to shine like silver water. An old man brought a diamond in his hand and gave it to Nemimang Konwar. Nemi Mang saw the old man&amp;#39;s appearance and everything about the future came to mind. He was silently pleased with the appearance. Then he came to the Lord and began to worship Him. The king, however, was silently afraid of the old man&amp;#39;s appearance. One day, Prince Nemimang left the palace and went to the forest to perform penance. Before that, the god (Chikya) had done three things for his penance. King Nemimang built a monastery for his penance, and left rice and fruits and other things to eat. When King Nemimang heard that he was going to perform penance, the gods came and welcomed him. The qualities he gave in the previous life made him more virtuous in the present life; Therefore, while he was performing penance, the gods came and began to worship him. While going to perform penance, Nemimang fell asleep on a large rock in the middle of the forest. He did not wake up, and the seat of the god Chaukaphet became as hard as a rock. Then the god Chauphafet looked from his heavenly throne at all the gods but saw no one. Then he looked down from heaven to the earth Therefore, it is important to understand the importance of these characteristics in the development of the country. Therefore, it is important to understand the importance of these characteristics in the development of the country. Then Chaufat Bajradata came down and explained everything to the prince. He said, &amp;quot;I did not send you to Martha to be jealous, but to acquaint you with the world. People say that giving flowers of brightness to God with rice instead of demons is the best gift, so now you go to earth and your future will be bright</content>

<content>08&amp;gt; We have been waiting for you to take us to Nirvana with you. The gift that you gave to the land, that is, the way you offered the rice of God, will lift you up very high. Your virtue of charity, your religion, is waiting for you. Once upon a time, a nun always gave Tao rice to the Lord and after her death, the virtue of that gift gave her a place in the heavenly heavens called Pushpa; This is how the god Chauphafet explained to the prince. &amp;#39;I told you clearly so that you would understand the virtue of giving rice to that Tangham Lord. So you can give the quality, it can never fail. After teaching the prince, Chikia returned to his throne in the kingdom of heaven called Tingsa. Then Prince Chau Nemimang also began to offer Taoham (rice) to the Sadar Lord. Chikia ascended to heaven and sat on a seat as soft as the cotton of his wife, the goddess Sudhama. Then the gods of the other heavens came and began to plead with the god Chikia, saying, &amp;#39;Chau Khaika Chicho, that is, O god of the heavens of Chingsa, you are the king of the heavens of Tingsa. Chaufat Vajradata was listening to all the words of the gods. Chaukat Vajradatar said to the gods, &amp;quot;Prince Nemimao did not want to come down to earth, so I went to him and learned the five things. The teacher of the five things was pleased with him Then the gods said to the gods, &amp;quot;Why do you go to him?&amp;quot;</content>

<content>In the Tai-Ahom language, put a golden throne on the Buddhist Kahin, and Nemimang must be lifted from below. The gods are waiting to meet him. After the god Chikia (Landon) gave the order to the drunken Natrisha, he turned to the waiting gods and explained it to them. He said to the gods, &amp;#39;You must not all go down to death. If I meet him in the golden chariot, I will bring him back soon. Do not be lazy, do not fail to get up very early in the morning and offer “Tangham” rice to the Lord. Immediately in the morning, pray to the Lord and wish in your mind to meet the Lord (chutang). You will always wish for wealth and gold to be given. Thus the god Chaufat spoke to the other gods. Then Chaufafet rode in a golden chariot and went in search of Prince Nemimang. They found the prince and took him in a chariot to heaven above the sky. Then the people on the earth stood still, their faces toward heaven, as far as the eye could see. When the prince was taken to heaven, millions of gods waiting in heaven lined up on the road to meet him. Their colors shone all around the kingdom of heaven. There were rows of trees on both sides of the road called Kank; The trees never withered or died. Nemimang Konwar was surprised to see the millions of gods waiting and asked Chaufate which way it was. Then the drunken god Natrisha replied to the prince that it was the way of your mortal world. Millions of people on earth live there, and the forests above us are the gods of heaven. From there, climbing further up, Sukhana is also found by the Queen of Chikia</content>

<content>351 goes. Nemima said to the god, &amp;#39;I (Muzarai) want to see hell. Take me to hell and show me. Vetira Devabhajan served him and said, &amp;#39;Lord, you should not wish to see hell; King Langdon is looking hard to see you. There is no place as bad as Mugarai, or hell; Go to Chikia first if you wish to see he is waiting for you.&amp;#39; Therefore, it is important to understand the importance of these issues. Therefore, it is important to understand the importance of these issues. Nemiad added &amp;#39;We will reach Langdon&amp;#39;s paradise only at the end of seeing everything through the clouds above the sky. After a while the prince reached the land of Landon Bazaar. The god Landon saw him and said, &amp;quot;Blood, there are many gods and goddesses waiting under heaven. The prince looked down and saw that the trees below and the water of the river looked red like fire. His eyes went to the plane, and by the time he saw the whole lower shell red. The prince saw it when he looked down from heaven, just as the bottom of the water looked very deep when he looked down from above Gani. He looked down from heaven and saw hell. There is so much suffering in hell. Thousands of people have fallen into the boiling hot water of hell and the rice is filled with bitter roast and rotten rice. The blood and flesh of the body melt in the heat of the fire, then the body is formed again and takes the form of a human being, and the angel of death catches it and throws it into hot water; There is no counting of how many thousands of years the land remains in the voice. Therefore, it is important to understand the importance of these issues. Therefore, it is important to understand the importance of these issues. They are suffering like this? Then Majni Naghar explained to Paubasha with both hands, &amp;#39;These people will steal many others when they are human when they have voices</content>

<content>352. They robbed people in greed, they robbed others by hurting them, they cursed those who spoke harshly. Therefore, they are now suffering from such hot water and the heat of the two. That is the result of their sin, so they are suffering. Then the prince Nemima said, &amp;#39;I am afraid of these sufferings. Shall I suffer like them?&amp;#39; Lukfi&amp;#39;, the god of sight, said, &amp;#39;If you live on earth and become angry with others and do evil things, harm others, then you will surely come and suffer like them, Lord. They went up to the hell and saw another hell burning people day and night. The whole country was full of dead bodies. There were many animals in the forest, including dogs and crows, which ate and ate from each other&amp;#39;s mouths what?&amp;#39; Therefore, it is important to understand the importance of these two aspects of the universe No one can escape suffering.</content>

<content>080 Nerimang Konwar told the god that he was very afraid of the people suffering in hell. The drunken Nasya deity in the Vedia sky said, &amp;#39;If you take away the property of others and grieve others, do not give anything to the gods or the demigods or other poor people, You will have to suffer. Prince Nemi Mang expressed his desire to see all the places in the city, their golden ship moving very fast. After passing through one city, he came to another city or country. It is impossible to imagine how many millions of years the animals of Namkir had to fall into the hot water of Mobha Tirovar. Their cries were desperate. Their bodies were sizzling like pork fat burned in a flue. The angel who kept him in hell was Abut ; They have huge iron spears in their hands. There were lonely people waiting inside that hell. The prince said, &amp;#39;I am more afraid to see such a face. These things cannot be seen with one&amp;#39;s own eyes. Then the god said to the king, &amp;quot;If you too do evil and feed people bad bods, grieve the poor, you too must land such a nabak. Then he passed the muddy pond and found another big pond Seeing them, the drunkard was pleased with Natrigha Sevata - are those people drinking the dirty water of blood?&amp;#39; Vedia Matali said to the market, sitting brightly inside the golden rakh, &amp;#39;Those people are very lonely, but they never serve their parents.</content>

<content>048 did not worship. He showed anger to the monks. He gave bad things to others. That is why they are going to this rotten pool of blood in hell. This is the result of their previous birth sins.&amp;#39; The prince said, &amp;#39;I am even more afraid of such suffering. Then the young man of heaven said to the king, &amp;#39;If you, the prince, were in their house, you would suffer the same pain. After passing the blood-stained pond, the prince looked out at the open world and saw another large four-wheeled pond. The pond is so big that it cannot be seen with the naked eye. The people of the earth are waiting in line in hell. Just as insects line up in search of food, so the people of the earth are waiting to go to hell, and the angels waiting in hell were as numerous as bees. They take a large stick in their hands and put it around people&amp;#39;s necks. Some he puts on his tongue ; They also apply the skin of a rotten dog to the neck of a man and pull it ; They die more often in grief. The prince said, &amp;#39;What evil have those people done that they are suffering day and night with fishing rods around their necks?&amp;#39; Then the drunken god replied to the prince, &amp;#39;While they were drunk, they were jealous of animals day and night and had no love for others. That is why they have to come to such a hell after death. After seeing the hell, the prince said to the gods, &amp;#39;Take my religion. Then the gods did not go away. One moment in the kingdom of heaven or heaven is a month or thirty days for our people on earth. Therefore, it is important to understand the importance of these factors in the development of the country&amp;#39;s economy. Therefore, it is important to understand the importance of these factors in the development of the country&amp;#39;s economy. After the offering, the prince looked south. One day suddenly the earth shook in a strange way</content>

<content>Det The people in the land were amazed and afraid. Some said there was the sound of a large rock falling. Suddenly the colors of the golden caves inside the country brightened. Some said that our king was the bravest and the most skilled. Therefore, the god Landon will carry our king on a golden chariot by the god Matali Nasa. Matali Nasa served the king and began to tell him everything, &amp;#39;O golden king, sitting in the palace. You, the king, beautifully offered rice to Taoham, the Lord, and worshiped Him. The gods in heaven welcomed you with the virtue of the religion of Tangham (worshipping) your God. Your religion is better than all mortals. So Langdon has sent me to call you. I have also brought Rakhan into your country. On the other hand, there are many gods waiting for you on both sides of the road. Langdon wishes to your sir.&amp;#39; Nemimang is living happily in the kingdom, so he wants to see you. He is sitting in Sudhama&amp;#39;s fortress waiting. Then the king replied to the murderous god, &amp;#39;I love the people of my country very much. Then the king sent for his great minister to go to Langdon in the kingdom of Tingsha heaven above. Then he went to heaven. After passing through one hell, the god B and Matali saw another. That hell is on an iron mountain. People don&amp;#39;t wear clothes like people on earth. They are always naked ; The flesh of their bodies had dried up. They were disgusted by the flies on their bodies. They were covered with large iron bars and removed from the body. The angel of death grabbed the people with a large iron and beat them. When they tried to escape, they approached both sides of the mountain and were recognized. There is human blood there</content>

<content>356 remains. When King Nemimang saw them, he asked the god he had seen, &amp;#39;Do these people live naked? Why do they have to be pierced with iron bars? What bad things or crimes did they commit? Will they continue to be pierced with iron bars for thousands of years?&amp;#39; Then the drunken god Nastya replied to the king that these women disrespected their husbands on earth and made love to others. She wanted another husband despite having her own. The gods see them doing such evil things, and their names are written down by the gods. So they are coming after death and suffering in this hell burning like a mountain. Their bodies are rebuilt even after melting. Hearing these words, King Nemimang turned his head towards the earth. He really saw their evil deeds and understood them well. The king went on from there again. Ahead he saw another large river flowing fast. In that river, millions of Yamadutas are binding millions of people with iron chains in their hands. Some people were caught at the base without being tied up and thrown into the water. They fell into the water and lost their lives. He was pulled up again by a chain. King Nemimang was afraid to hear their cries. The god explained to the king, &amp;#39;These people were very wicked when they lived on earth. People rejoiced by holding their hands around their necks. and these women ignored their husbands and went after their own desires. The gods did not like those bad things. Therefore, the angel of death threw them into the hell of the big river. When King Nemihang saw the suffering of the people, he expressed his sorrow and said that the people were suffering greatly. Vedia is not drunk...she replied, &amp;#39;If you don&amp;#39;t want to fall, think carefully</content>

<content>357 Buddhist Jataka Story in Tai-Ahom Language Try to avoid this. No one can tell when death will come. If you, the king, want to be good in every way, you must keep your mind steady like a temple and love millions of people and animals. He will rescue all the old and young, animals and creatures on earth, when they are in trouble or in danger. All good and evil are always mixed in our hearts. King Khaifa will never forget these things. Langdon told the prince to live in several layers in heaven; He didn&amp;#39;t let them live in hell. Seeing hell, the king wanted to return to mortality soon. When he came from hell, the king (Nungfi) saw the kingdom of heaven. &amp;#39;As King Langdon said, you may move to the kingdom of heaven. As soon as you are born again, you will go up and live in a new &amp;#39;patchat&amp;#39;, that is, a new fortress,” said the god Matali Nasa to King Nemimang. He added, &amp;#39;If you wish to go further, there is no end to us watching it all year round. Hell is so vast that there are 128 bowls in it. People who leave mortals suffer only in eight cycles. Some suffer from scorching heat.&amp;#39; Meanwhile, King Langdon came from his former place and waited for the king. The god Chikia told the king, &amp;#39;You have seen all hell and heaven because of your religion. Then they began to go back to heaven from hell.

In his previous life, his father did not allow him to leave the palace. But because of the merits of his previous life, Frye was forced to leave the palace and the city in yellow clothes. Elders from far and wide came to Phra and they asked Phra for the tra (path) and the way to attain Nivana without suffering. The bird incarnation, Fry Urak Fa, gave good advice to the king and queen. Their minds were cleansed when they heard them. Everyone felt that they had reached the heaven called Tuksira because their hearts were completely cleansed. Even the Chang all (including the gods) were fascinated by the spiritual power of the Phar. Phar&amp;#39;s mind was clear and steady. Frack was loved and welcomed around the country. The golden-winged fry sat on the throne, shining like the sun, preaching. 1 376 One day Urak Fai remembered that he had been on the golden mountain before and flew away from the palace of the wingless king. The duck didn&amp;#39;t want to let go. They flew together and left the city of Varanasi and flew east. After attaining Buddhism, Frye saw memories of the past with spiritual power. When he was a duck, he persuaded thousands of disciples to follow the rules. Khaifa Fry called the shils (rules) as stories to keep them clear in the minds of the disciples. Fry left the palace on a white horse in search of Nivana. Only the man named Aichan in the father-kingdom knew that.

<content>The Tai-Ahom language does not believe in Buddhist caste stories. Some donate flowery white umbrellas in the name of the Phra, build roads, bridges, etc., do not harm the donors, do not harm the monks or the poor when they donate things or necessities. They follow the principles of Fr. Some do not want to give food, do not give alms—you should not associate with these fools. Stay away from them. Never think of bad things as good. According to him, one should pay attention to religion by following the principles of the Phra. Khunkam, king of the city of Varanasi, followed the policy of Phra and made his beautiful daughter queen of his kingdom before going to heaven ; He followed the advice of Fr. The king&amp;#39;s ministers and subjects also followed the policy of the king. Fry stayed with the king and spread the religion among all the animals of the world and blessed everyone. The brave nuns listened attentively to Fr. 378 - Fry gave many analogies. A king purified his heart by giving of his own free will. He was broad-minded in following the principles (shila). It was as clear as the water of a nectar pond. Another man was one who did not forget the qualities of the priest and followed his principles. He never hurt his parents by feeding them. They were not neglected in any way. When he saw an elderly person outside his own family, he spoke to him in a soft voice, as if he were speaking to his brother. The other type of people were those who knelt down and served the great men who studied religion. They never committed any offense or insult to the monks (fungi).

When alcohol enters the body, people say bad things. You have to make up your mind. Thus Fry explained to the disciples, “O my monks, kings who rule the kingdom, as well as men and women, the givers and the gift-givers, listen to these. They write the names of the righteous in golden books. He goes to heaven. There is a palace there. The daughters of the gods are as numerous as flowers.

In the past, there was a great sage named Gautama Buddha who lived on earth. At that time the gods and men of heaven and earth rejoiced, and they all came and filled themselves like bees in the golden fields. Some of them stood there and looked away Some brought white rice to give to the frock and worshiped the frock Their wishes were fulfilled according to their wishes. Seeing the audience, rich and poor, merchants, etc., coming to him in droves, Fry began to say, &amp;#39;You will be born human and earn religion. If you want to go to Nirvana, do not neglect religion. O monks and pilgrims! The gods! Therefore, it is necessary to burn like fire in the mind because of the presence of impermanent or bad karmic qualities in the human body. People are blinded by delusion.

When I took the incarnation of the fry golden-feathered Urakfa bird, I lived in the golden mountains of joy and forgot everything. Then I fell into a trap and couldn&amp;#39;t get out. People were happy to see me struggling in pain. Thus Frye told the monks and disciples of the events of the past. Many of the advice was very simple and brief. The words of the Fr touched the ears of the people and their minds became clean. He allowed his disciples to explain his words. He preached the Dharma while incarnating as a bird in the city of Varanasi. There the hearts of the people were purified. “I settled in the womb of a large bird. They laid their eggs only after a long time. I was an egg in the forest and among snakes and crocodiles. But they did not devour me. One day a poor man came and went and found me in the form of an egg. The white brightly lit egg looks like the moon. Later I became a puppy! The feathers were not fully grown for a long time. Slowly my body took full shape. The neck became long. They became bodies like molten gold. They lived with other birds in the forest and filled the forest. They all came to me and made me their king. Wherever I go, they fly with me. They fly after them in flocks. I didn&amp;#39;t eat alone. I shared the food with everyone, young and old. But not all birds felt that way. Some commit crimes. Others come and tell me. Then I say, death is inevitable. Follow my advice. Keep my counsel in mind. All the birds praised my policy.&amp;#39;</content>

<content>CHAPTER XVI CHANGE As the Ahom kings and worthy ministers converted to various combinations of Hinduism and Vaishnavism, the Mohans, Bailungs and Deodhais, the pioneers of the true Ban Phi-Phuralung religion of the Ahoms, became neglected. They became almost untouchable compared to other Ahoms who were newly converted to Hinduism. The Ahom people were influenced by Hindu priests and other influential circles who gained royal favor and imposed restrictions on marriage, eating and drinking. As a result of this conversion to Hinduism or Aryanism, the royally favored priesthood identified the Tai Ahom deity Fa-nuru Landon with Indra, Jachingpha as Saraswati, Lankuri as Shiva and invented a new interpretation of the origin of the Swargadevas. Therefore, we get a new interpretation of the origin of the ancestors of Sukapha and such stories placed the Ahoms above Nadiyal and below Keot and alongside Chutia and Koch on the Hindu caste ladder. There are many different types of Vaishnavism, including Brahma Sanhati, Purusha Sanhati, Nika Sanhati and Kala Sanhati. They were divided into different groups and could not eat from each other.</content>

<content>Many of the Ahoms, especially those who were converted to the Mayamara Vaishnavism of the Ahom period, began to identify themselves as Mataks. He even hid his ancestry. The Ahom, who took refuge at the Mayamara Satra during the Moamari rebellion, joined the rebellion and abandoned their Ahom identity. The Mayamara Ahom, even the Ahoms of noble families, kept their Ahom identity secret by giving high status to religion. There are many ways in which you can improve your self-confidence. There are many ways in which you can improve your self-confidence. I haven&amp;#39;t heard anything from Thanua. That brother is in the game named Rahan. The son of Bahkata, Manchoka, the son of Manchoka, Kanu Dihingia Fukan, the son of Sonaram Gohani, called the house. The son of Bahakata is called Bhokolapura Gohani Ghar. His brother Parbatia Gohani went to his home in Mayamara Satra. This is written in the history of the Bargohai dynasty. In addition, a descendant of Nangbang&amp;#39;s son Mathadangia Bargohai went to the north coast and became a disciple of the Mayamara Satra. Therefore, it is important to note that the Ahom priestly class of Khanamukhia Mohan became a disciple of Mayamara and now becomes the Mazhamria Ahom and Matak. There are many such examples. In spite of this, some of these Matkial Ahoms have not abandoned their customs. They still follow the Ahom customs of giving graves, calling the eldest of the clan the eldest, and using Ahom relationship words. The food policy is almost the same. Apart from alcohol, crabs, squid, squid, dried fish, and smoked fish are also eaten. In addition, the practice of night service began to prevail among some of the Ahom people. There are several gosai named Ramdev, Shyamdev, Shukdev and Sunanda who introduced the night service among the Ahom, Chutia, Miching and Kacharis. These gurus composed some Vaishnava songs and spread them among the devotees and attracted many Ahoms. Many Ahoms, especially in southern Assam, adopt this method. These teachers are wine,</content>

Ramai or Ramdev, one of Gopaldev&amp;#39;s disciples, was the guru who introduced this night service. He is the grandson of Saru Krishnadev, the founder of Chaliha Bargher Satra, and the son of Sudarshan Dev. Ramdev and Sunandadev composed the devotional songs performed at night services. For the devotees of this night, Shankar and Shiva are the deities worshiped and Shankardev and Bhola Shankar are the same. The devotees worship the Guru on such occasions and in their view the Guru is everything. Night services are also called Kevali, Paka, Bhitar Seva, Thera Phulia, etc. All rituals, rituals and worship services are very secret They hold night services behind a wall and keep them secret. The night services reflect Tantric Buddhism and Tantric Shaivism. There is no discrimination, gender or caste in this programme. Devotion is the chief; There is nothing but devotion.

This ceremony is also called &amp;#39;Barseva&amp;#39; They perform this &amp;#39;Barseva&amp;#39; by performing Vaishnava songs and reciting scriptures such as kirtans in a beautiful and melodious manner. There are four masses: Phulbihar, Nij Bihar, Gopi Bihar and Naga Bihar. Only the saint and the seven can hold the sacred luk-lao (wine) and only the devotees of Gopi Bihar and Naga Bihar can participate in Naga Bihar. Only the devotees who have given up Maya and Moha attain the last aur and attain the realization of God by participating in the last ritual (Naga Bihar).

<content>Change easily gives the seat of God. Many people try to call the Ahom religion Buddhism. The main reason for this is the birth stories in the Ahom language such as Nemimang Phura, Urak Fa Phra, etc. In fact, the people who came with Sukaya followed the religion of the king. The religion brought by Tukapha is the Ban-Fi religion and this religion has a system of sacrifice to appease the gods and goddesses There are detailed accounts of sacrifices to be made to these gods and goddesses in the Charideo Barbidhi and Charideo Bidhi. Moreover, a warrior nation offers sacrifices in its worship to gain strength. There is nothing surprising about this 387 However, the Furalung worship without a sacrifice was performed by the priesthood once a year and publicly every 5/10 years. Although the Furalung Puja is now universal and some of the Ahoms (except the priestly class) perform it, there is no precedent for the ordinary Ahom to perform it before. There is no precedent for a king to do so. The characteristics of this Furalung worship have already been mentioned. In this puja, the almighty God Fa-tu-ching-frang-hum is worshiped with meat, offerings and fruits in a completely sattvic manner without any sacrifice. They build a lighthouse here and worship the formless Lord Fa-tu Ching-Frang-ham in the form of light-Brahma in the beginning by singing Furanam and chanting names in recognition of the creation of the universe. As mentioned earlier, when Sukapha left the country of Myung Maolung, the Tais of that country were not without the influence of Mahayana Buddhism In addition, the Tai were influenced by Confucian teachings and Lao Tzu&amp;#39;s Taoism. The teachings of Lao Tzu, Confucius, and the Buddha had a profound influence on their way of life.</content>

<content>Change It is true that although Buddhist Jataka story books are found among the Ahom, Buddhism has not had much influence. There is no element of Confucianism or Taoism in the Ahom religion. Many Ahom writers refer to the religion of the Tai Ahom as Taoism because these two words are similar and have the same sound. There are many people who mistakenly believe that the original religion of the Ahom was Taoism. She conforms to the teachings of Buddhism and the instructions of the cane. So the Tais, assuming that the Tai cane instructions were identical with the words of the Buddha, did not interfere with their attempt to identify Phra (Phura) and the Buddha. Almost all the Tai Ahoms of Assam converted to Buddhism. Her cane instructions are as follows: (1) Do not lie, (2) Do not kill animals without cause, (3) Do not take money and property by cheating, (4) Do not oppress women and the weak, and (5) Do not eat unclean food. These five oaths help people to practice human religion. By taking an oath as a truthful person to the Supreme Truth, the eternal truth and beauty are considered and life becomes more meaningful. There are many reasons why the Ahom religion is called Buddhism. There are many reasons why the Ahom religion is called Buddhism. These words are - (1) Fa-tra-alang - which Buddhists simply want to call the Bodhisattva of Buddhism. 388 (2) Chi-ki-ya - which means they want to say Shakyamuni. - (3) Ni-pan - means Nirvana. $ Ahom scholars interpret it as follows : (1) Phra-ti-alang or Phura-tara-alang means Phra means God Tra or Tara means advice or principle and Alang means Almighty.</content>

<content>(2) Chi-ki-ya means chi means to endure, ki means to blossom or be re-created and ya or aa is your (God&amp;#39;s) position in pervasiveness. (3) Ni-pa-n or ra-ni-pan means more, ni means to go away and &amp;#39;pan&amp;#39; means to return, i.e. the quality of God who returns even though He is an expanded form. The Ahom scholars interpret the words chi-ki-a-ra-ni-pan together to mean that God is stable, that is, He returns even though He is present in the universe and in His manifest but expanded form. They don&amp;#39;t even read the Jataka Puthi Nemimang Fura, they just keep it. The inscriptions on the two stone pillars of Majet in Myanmar show the name &amp;#39;Buddha&amp;#39; written in Karmi instead of &amp;#39;Buddha&amp;#39; in Pali. This inscription is written in four languages in Dharmi, p. Pali and Mon. The inscription is similar to the Ahom script brought by Sukapha in its Mon script, written during the reign of the Burmese king Kanjitha of the Sagan Empire in the 12th century. k This word &amp;#39;Puraha&amp;#39; means &amp;#39;Buddha&amp;#39; and is spelled &amp;#39;Bhura&amp;#39; in Burmese but pronounced &amp;#39;Phaya&amp;#39; or Fro. The word &amp;#39;Bra Ishwar&amp;#39; in the ancient Fimanka inscriptions of the Jem language is believed to be derived from the Sanskrit Pali word &amp;#39;Bra&amp;#39; or &amp;#39;Phra&amp;#39; As mentioned earlier, the Tai word fo or &amp;#39;fura&amp;#39; began to refer to the Buddha when Mahayana Buddhism became popular in Tai-inhabited China and Burma. In the 12th century, Mahayana Buddhism influenced the Tai. Buddhist preachers easily refer to the &amp;#39;Fa&amp;#39; or &amp;#39;Fura&amp;#39; or &amp;#39;Fa-tu-ching-frong-hum&amp;#39; of the Hai as &amp;#39;God&amp;#39; or &amp;#39;Fry Buddha&amp;#39;</content>

<content>It begins to explain change. So it was easier to spread Buddhism. When the Ahom came from Myung Maolung, they brought the Nemimang Phura and Urak Fa Phra as religious books under the influence of Mahayana Buddhism. However, the influence of Buddhism remained limited as the almighty god Phra or Phura-Tara-Alang was not worshiped by sacrifice. Later, the imagination of &amp;#39;Taradevi&amp;#39; in Phura-Tara-Alang is quite late. There is no precedent for the worship of Tara Devi Earlier, Phuratara-alang meant Almighty God. Mahayana Buddhism has influenced the Ahom moral preparation and the Chakklang marriage system. It is noteworthy that the Furalung Puja does not include the preparation of morals and the absence of sacrifices. This zone is influenced by Mahayana Buddhism. Therefore, the Ahom religion is not Buddhism even if it is influenced by Mahayana Buddhism. The main religion of the Ahom is Ban-Fi. This religion worships various gods and goddesses, mainly Landon. Various Tai scholars and priestly classes have made it clear that they consider the eight deities - Landon, Khaokham, Islandin, Jasingpha, Jan Sai Hum, Chit Lam Cham, Mutkum Tai Kum, Lankuri - to be their favorite deities and Landon to belong to Phura-Taraalang Fa-tu-ching-frang-hum or the representative of Phura and their chief deity. The Furalung system of worship is the supreme truth of the Ahom ethics of Kheklai Bet that do not do violence to anyone or kill anyone – there is no sacrifice in the name of the formless God. However, sacrifice is essential to the ban-fi system of the Ahom religious life and has been practiced since ancient times. The wise Ahom scholars and priests do not accept the Furalung system of the Ahom as a Buddhist system and say that they have neglected the significance of the Ahom motto &amp;#39;Chao Nu Ru Chao Kao Ai&amp;#39; only since their acquaintance with the Buddhist Tai people. 390 of the Ahom religion</content>

<content>All the gods and goddesses and the invisible one are in heaven and therefore &amp;#39;Chao-nur-chao-kao oi&amp;#39; is worshiped by putting hands on the forehead and bowing to the gods and goddesses above This is a significant aspect. In addition, other Tai people in Assam have tried to describe &amp;#39;Phura-Tara Alang&amp;#39; as Buddha, Dharma and Bodhisattva, and other Tai people abroad have tried to say that the three words &amp;#39;Phura-Tara Alang&amp;#39; in the Ahom refer to Buddha-dharma and Bodhisattva. These people want to say that the word &amp;#39;Chikia&amp;#39; means vegetables and Nibani This is not really the case. This is Cait! The word has a different meaning 391 It is true that in the history of their settlement in China and Burma, their original religion was dominated by the worship of gods and goddesses associated with natural forces and was influenced by Taoism and Confucian principles. Later, from the beginning of the first century, first Mahayana Buddhism and later Hinayana Buddhism were influential. The Ban-Fi religion of the Bhai Ahom was the main religion of all the Tai people, both kings and subjects of Mumaolung at that time. The Ban-Fi religion is based on the worship of Shakti and was prevalent throughout the Tai-inhabited region. This religion was brought to Assam by Chao Lung Chukapha and his followers in the early thirteenth century and has not been abandoned by the Tai-Ahoms. Also the Phuratara-along or Phuralung system was then her religion in that area but as the foundation of this religion was non-violence, it was confined to the priestly class only. The powerful brothers at the time emphasized the Ban-Fi religion, which was based on the worship of Shakti, and therefore the non-violent Furalung religion was not popular among the Prabhas and the aggressive Tai. Therefore, it is difficult to find any example in history of the celebration of Furalung Puja by Chao Lung Chu-ka-fai or other Ahom kings. This is the ban-fee</content>

<content>In addition to the eight gods of the Parivartan religion, they worshiped the dead gods, the ancestors, and held dam-pujas at home. These eight gods and the Dam-fi (god of the dead) were the eastern gods of the Tai people at that time, and Landon was the best of them. But the idea of a formless God was among them, and if they could persuade Fa-tu-sing-flom Hum or Phura to be the Buddha, the obstacles to their preaching would be removed. So she could easily attract people by preaching that Phura is Buddha, Buddha is Phura and converted some Banfi people to Mahayani and then Hinyani by easily merging Phura-Tara-Alang as Buddha-Dharma-Sangha and then Buddha-Dharma-Bodhisattva. However, the influence of this religion was not evident in the powerful Tai countries of Maolung, Mummit, and Myungkong until the time of Sukapha&amp;#39;s departure for Assam; There is no precedent for the ruling class in particular to be influenced by this religion. Finally, in the late thirteenth century, Buddhism spread to these regions. Thailand was formed in 1321 AD. In time, the whole of Thailand and the region inhabited by Tai fell under the influence of Buddhism. Sukapha and his followers were not attracted to Buddhism and there is no influence. When Sukapha left the country, the Buddhist Jatakas took the form of fairy tales and became popular among the educated Tais, especially the priestly class. Later, during the reign of the kings of Assam, especially the Ahom kings who married the daughters of the kings of Naradesh, new Tai-priests came with the brides. In addition, the Ahom kingdom continued to exchange people with the countries of Bar-Nara and Saru-Nara and the priestly class also came in the process. It is noteworthy that during the reign of Gaurinath Singh, several Ahom priests went to Saru-Nara country and Tai was king at that time</content>

<content>He collected the genealogies of the Parivartans and the genealogies of Swargadeo Sukapha. Therefore, such an influx of Tai priests led to the influx of priests among the Ahom and they wrote Buddhist books such as the Jataka in the Ahom language on behalf of the Ahom. The birth books, such as Urak-fa-fra, were written with the efforts of these later priests and with the interest of the established priests. But in the Furalung Puja, only the &amp;#39;Pak Pen Ka Ka Dharmashastra&amp;#39; is recited. The book is only one, not read. The Ahom priests do not give priority to the birth books. However, the religious ethics of Khek Lai Bet are similar to those of Buddhism and Taoism. It is worth clarifying that the birth books such as Nemimang Phura, Urak Fa Phra (the story of this birth has been added in a previous chapter) are not the same as the Phuralung books. The Furalung book found in the Patsanko region deals with how the Supreme Being Fatu-sing-Frang-hum or Fura created gods, goddesses, humans, animals, etc., and how a god named Pukfi appeared in the Muphi kingdom adopted the policy. After death, people become dam-fi and go to the kingdom of the gods and do not take any form of the gods. The Book of Mercy How the Merciful Supreme Being created the earth and how the kings of the kingdom of the gods adopted the principle of Fura, that is, the principle of harmony for all. Later, Day Fura changed his policy and took the name of Nangsisao or Barseman and lived in the forest and worshiped Kalimati Gosani. The kings began to worship Barseman and Lankuri and Nangsisau and worshiping them as Ai Mang (Kechaikhati) brought good luck everywhere. They are the ones who are able to do this</content>

<content>394 Change began to prevail in human society. Learned priests say that the Furalung Book was written by Tengrai Machai, son of Senkaluk Machai. Therefore, he wrote this book only after coming to Assam. The main statement of the Furalung books is that non-violence is the supreme religion. Therefore, there is no sacrifice in Furalung Puja. The Ahom have not changed their diet despite converting to Hinduism and Vaishnavism. They are seen to be initiated by Brahmins and Gosai and surrendered by Satradhikars. The Tai-Ahoms eat pork, pig farming, mugaleta, dried fish, dried fish, mangoes, coconut milk, barley, barvekola, dogs, kalabari, linkari, kuchia etc., which may not be eaten by other Hindus and Vaishnavas. They also prepare nam-lao and wine at home. However, the pioneers and preachers of Hinduism could not impose restrictions on this practice for the sake of spreading Hinduism and Vaishnavism. There are many different types of wine and chicken meat used in the night rituals of the Ahom people. n The present Ahom follow Hinduism and Vaishnavism, yet believe in the original Banfi religion. There are many Ahom families who gradually believed in the Banfi religion and reverted to the original Ahom religion. Whether they are Vaishnavas or Hindus, they worship the Madam-Me-Fi, Chakklong, Khaokham, etc. of the original religions. In addition, many Ahoms who are not of the priestly lineage nowadays serve as priests in the Ahom worship. Deodhai, Mohan and Bailung, however, have been playing the role of guides in how to follow the rules and regulations of the Adi religion. The Mohan-Deodhai-Bailung Conference has played a major role in this regard. The rituals associated with birth, death and marriage are observed by all the Ahoms.</content>

<content>changes are seen; It is natural that some changes will occur in these reforms. In the case of birth rites, it is noteworthy that all Ahoms believe that pregnant women face many restrictions. Just as having a child is a joy, the family views it as a duty to care for a pregnant woman. There are many prohibitions such as not going to the kitchen, not touching the barn, not going to the temple and deoshal or namghar, not giving food to the elderly. This prohibition remains until a month after delivery. It is better to give birth in the husband&amp;#39;s house (not in the mother&amp;#39;s house). The rules of cutting the navel, burning fire to fulfill the work of the unborn child and mother, weaving the maternity net from the nose, and taking the mother out to carry the child are followed by all Ahom families. Only the Adi Ahom family calls a priest in this regard. In the case of marriage, the Ahom family marries in the manner of Chal. Sometimes they kidnap and marry. However, the use of coconut water is a wedding rule. The dress given by the joron to the mother of the bride in the same joro as other Assamese people can be called bride-price. There are many different types of ceremonies and rituals that are performed in the Ahom religion. There is a lack of burial places for the Tai-Ahom families. The body is washed by the Ahon, and the particles are broken and allowed to flow on the forehead. I&amp;#39;m wearing new clothes</content>

<content>All Ahom families wear changes. They are buried without a grave due to lack of space. 396 The tomb custom continued from the days of Swargadeo Sukapha to the days of Swargadeo Pramatta Singh. When Rajeshwar Singh Swargadeo passed away, his body was cremated and buried with his bones and ashes. Therefore, it is important to note that the present study is not a comprehensive study of the history of the country. Therefore, it is important to note that the present study is not a comprehensive study of the history of the country. Later, on the advice of the Deodhai Pandits, the tomb of Rajeshwar Singh was restored according to the Ahom custom. There are two tombs mentioned in the history of Rajeshwar Singh Swargadeo nearby. Rajeshwar Singh Swargade ordered the cremation. The Deodhai, Mohan and Bailung clans all observe the Rik. With the end of the Ahom Empire, Rik Khun-Mukhan, the revival of the country, was not held. However, the Ahom priesthood celebrates Rik Khun Puja with great reverence. Even after initially taking refuge in the Gosai, they did not stop worshiping the Rik Khan. Other Ahom families, however, hold the rik when they marry in the Chaklong system. Even Ahom families initiated into Vaishnavism celebrate Chaklong and it is compulsory to celebrate Rik Khun when Chaklong is celebrated. There are other reasons why Ahom families are usually converted to Hinduism or Vaishnavism. If someone drowns and is afraid, if someone is sick for a long time and is in bed, the old women go in groups and fetch water from the river, first worship the god Khaokham and sing his name. Therefore, it is important to bathe the sick person and bless him with a speedy recovery. If there is a Mohan, Deodhai or Bailung priest nearby, the priest also takes a boat to the river</content>

<content>The change goes and the fish- puthi, crabs, etc. that come up in the sack are cooked and fed to the sick Lakhim festival is celebrated in priestly families or villages but less so in other Ahom villages. In the Lakhim festival, which is held without a priest, women go to a beach, river or stream with water in groups and a woman rows a boat to fetch water. This is called Lakhim Tola. The fish or anything else is taken home and kept in the barn as a lakhina. It is also another form of Lakhim Sabah. Now the Ahom understand how their language and culture are being lost under the influence of Hinduism. The Ahom priesthood, which once expelled the Mohan-Deoi-Bailung from the seven houses of the Ahom under the influence of Hinduism, is now being re-embraced by the Ahom. There is still a Namghar in Mohan Deoai Bailung village. Occasionally, gosai or devotees come from the satra to collect taxes. But there is no Nam-Kirtan in that Namghar today The present Mohan-Deodhai-Baipung do not convert to Vaishnavism. On the other hand, they are following their original religion. Other Ahoms have become Hindus; There are many devotees of Auniati Satra. They are Vaishnavas but they worship the original gods and goddesses of the Ahoms as Me-Dam-Me-Fi. The number of Ahom who follow the old rules of the Ahom is slowly increasing. However, some have become Buddhists and have participated in the worship of the gods and goddesses of the original religion. There is no place for sacrifice in Furalung Puja. Therefore, some Ahoms are trying to call it Buddhism. However, people are slowly becoming attracted to the old Ahom religion Banfi Furalung Therefore, a revival took place and the Ahom worshiped Khaokham and Landon. Meanwhile, the Vaishnava path of Hinduism</content>

<content>There is also the effect of change night-eating. However, the Tai-Ahom have kept the same rules in eating and drinking. The practice of burial is on the verge of extinction due to lack of space. But the wave of this revival is blowing strongly today and they are embracing the graveyard again. However, the Chakklong rules are followed in the case of marriages. In this case, the names of the gods and goddesses of the early Ahom religion are taken according to the Chaklong ritual. The Ahom rindhan method is applicable only to Chaklang weddings. However, the Chaklong wedding keeps the rikkhan or life-giving ceremony alive. 398 R Stick Bancheng looks at the book</content>
