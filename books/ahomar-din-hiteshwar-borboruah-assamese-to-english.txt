Alexander of Greece is also said to be the son of Jupiter and the first king of Rome, Romulus Mars, the son of Kartik. Apart from that time, the king of Kamrup in our country, Biswa Singh, is also called the son of Shir, the dynasty of the Chutia kings is also called the dynasty of Kubera, and even the Bar Bhuiyans want to prove that they are Suryavanshis; At one time they were also called the descendants of Shiva. The Ahoms also call them Devanshis. Their king is called Indravanshi and the others are called the descendants of the gods Sun, Moon, etc. Historically, they did not have the name Ahom before, and this country was not called Assam or Assam. This country was formerly called Kamrup. This country is very ancient, it is described in ancient history, Puranas In ancient times, the country was the constituency of the kingdoms of Kasrup, Sonitpur, Kundil, Hirambha, Jayantipur and Manipur. In time, when those countries fell, they all became known as Kamarupa. , the incarnation of Ramachandra in the Tretayuga. In the days of his great-grandfather Raghuraja, the country was famous for elephants, as it is now. The king of Kamarupa received special honor in the sacrifice of Raghu. The incarnation of Krishna in the Dvapara Yuga. The country was famous in this era as well. There is special evidence of this in the Banaparvas of the Mahabharata.

<content>They were married in the days of the Ahoms. Maharaja! Duryodhana&amp;#39;s queen Bhanumati, Arjuna&amp;#39;s wife Chitrangada and Ulupi, the daughter of the serpent, and Hirimba, the beloved wife of Bhima, the second Pandava, were daughters of this country. The country of King Chandrahansa of the Mahabharata belongs to this country. Apart from Isha, the Behula of this country is ever famous. Earlier, the country was divided into four pilgrimage sites: Ratnapith, Kampith, Swarnapith and Soumarpith. The &amp;#39;Ratnapeeth&amp;#39; is located from the Kartora River to the Swarnakosh River in Bagura sub-division of Bengal. The Swarnakosh River is the eastern boundary of Charipeeth Kochbehar and the western boundary of Goalpara in Kamrup. From Swarnakosh to the Rupika River, the Rupika River is the Rupi River in present-day Nagaon district. Some people consider it to be the eastern boundary of the northern bank of Kamrup district and the western boundary of Daranj district This is called Rupika There are many different types of &amp;#39;Swarnapeeth&amp;#39; from Rupika to the Bhairavi River. This is the Bharlu River, just south of Tezpur. From Bhairavi to Dikarbasini, there is enough &amp;#39;Soumar Peeth&amp;#39; the place of the goddess near Dikkarbasini Sadiya; The modern name of Dirbasini is the Dikrai or Dikranga River. This is the present-day Ujnikhand or Upper Assam. Swarnapeeth is in central Assam and Kampeeth is in lower Assam. The Himalayas lie to the north of the country. The southern mountains are inhabited by mountain tribes such as the Vot, Dafla, Aka, Abar, Michimi and Singphou. To the south are the Nagas, Khasias, Garos and other mountainous regions People live there. The Brahmaputra River originates in the Manas Lake in the northern Himalayas. It flows first eastward and then westward, dividing Assam into northern and southern banks (or banks), and joins the Ganges, which originates and descends along the banks of the lake, in the Dhaka district of Bengal. Small rivers flow from the mountains of the north and south of the country and flow into the Luit, one or the other with or alone. This country is a wonderful playground of nature, with many kinds of natural beauty. Looking north from the banks of the Brahmaputra, the snow-capped peaks of the Himalayas suggest that the sages are doing penance, looking at the sun with their white hair outstretched, and praying to God for the relief of this country. There are many places to do penance in solitude. Sitting in those places, watching the unique beauty of nature, the eternal • The historical significance of these narratives is still to be determined. , 1999 .</content>

<content>Everyone came here and performed penance in many places. That is why there are many ashrams of sages in this country, that is why there are many pilgrimage sites. This country, however, was also very difficult in the past. Therefore, King Jarasandha of Magadha will take away his kingdom Many kings were imprisoned in the southern part of the country. Bhima killed Jarasandha and freed them by the strategy of Krishna. This country was formerly inhabited by the Asuras or non-Aryans. It is the land of non-Aryan kings like Banasura, Narakasura, Hirimba, Babruvahana and others. Gradually the Aryan stream flowed into India and the Aryan seven settled in this country as well. Gradually Aryanism spread in this country, and many of the sons of the asuras adopted Aryanism and merged with the Aryan seven; Many remained in that ignoble way. The indigenous peoples like Garo, Mikir, Naga, Dafla etc. are the seven non-Aryans. This country is formerly inaccessible and there are many unheard of wonders about it abroad. After a long period of Hindu kings, Buddhism was prevalent in the country for a long time. Gradually, Buddhism disappeared and Hinduism was restored and several small kingdoms were established. It was at this time that some Shans came and established their first kingdom in Rikhanda. Their kingdom gradually expanded, eventually reaching Karatwa. They are the Shan people who are known as the Ahom in this country. The kings of the Ahoms are called Indravanshis. They are also said to have originated from the Indra dynasty In ancient times, on its Saumarpitha, south of the mountain called Hirkut, north of the Swarnadri, in the middle of it, on the mountain of the origin of an Indra dynasty called Bihugatri, there was a place called Ratnabhumi They were playing sports. There was a cave in the mountain where the sage Bashishta was performing penance. One day the sage went out to take a bath and saw Indra playing with Sachi in his garden. The sage became very angry and cursed Indra that he would become a human being. He left the place and went to the Nilachal Mountain in the northeast corner of Ratnapeeth and took refuge there. That ashram is now called Bashishtashram. Indra immediately became a very inferior and giant-like man under the curse of the sage. There are many ways to get a job in the field of architecture. There are many ways to get a job in the field of architecture They went to heaven crying. Then a beautiful wife of a giant who lived in the mountains saw the giant Indra near the ashram</content>

<content>There are many ways to get a job, but the most important thing is to get a job. There are many ways to get a job, but the most important thing is to get a job. Therefore, it is important to understand the meaning of the word &amp;#39;Indra&amp;#39; in the form of a giant. Then the two of them had intercourse. Then, freed from the curse, Indra said to the wife of the giant, &amp;quot;Know, dear!&amp;quot; and the son that shall come out of thy womb shall be king. His sons and grandsons will become kings in many places on earth Then Indra went to heaven and the giant woman went home. In time, Indra gave birth to a son in 441 BC. At his birth the gods rejoiced and played many instruments in heaven, and the Gandhavas sang; The ten directions became manifest ; The lakes became clear. The boy&amp;#39;s characteristics are curly hair, a lion&amp;#39;s neck, turned hair, red hands and feet and eyes. The right hand is also three sesame seeds, conch, and lotus ; Ankush, mace in left hand, three lines on abdomen; Kanti is rich. and she called his name Then Kham. When Dhekham was young, Indra once gave him a god named Chomdeo, a Hendan named Agnu, a pair of Dhak named Tiger and two pairs of chickens named Kai-seng,-mung, to worship according to Apuric They, strong under the influence of dairy substances, conquered as far as the Golden Mountains and became kings. Thekham had 18 princesses and 100 princes. Among them, Khulang follows him. This Khulung-Khun Lai was the first ancestor of the Ahom kings The remaining 98 princes are younger than Khun Lung-Khun Lai. Then Then Kham ruled the 98 princes in the mountains of his kingdom. Then Indra, the king of the gods, met with Jachingpha, or Goddess Saraswati, and decided that there had been many kings of the Sun and Moon dynasties, who were kings over all the gods, but there had never been any king of my dynasty. Therefore, my son should be king there. Indra sent Lungchainet, that is, the wind, to heaven and asked him to go to the plains of the earth to become king They gave Khulung and Khulai the dairy items they had given to Dhekham earlier, such as Chomdeo, Hep Dan, Bardhak and Kai-sel-yug, and said, “Khun lung! You&amp;#39;re great; You shall be king ; and Khun Laik as your prince</content>

<content>Keep the beginning with you. There are many ways to get a job, but the most important thing is to get a job. There are many ways to get a job, but the most important thing is to get a job. Sprinkle the water that washed Chom Deok on everyone and eat it with devotion. Don&amp;#39;t touch and look at Chomdeo often. Don&amp;#39;t let anyone else touch you. If anyone looks at it, there will be confusion and death in the land. The Hengda is &amp;#39;Khan-Kham Fafa&amp;#39;, meaning the primordial power asked from the Goddess. You&amp;#39;ll tie it to the pole Serve those who betray you. If the hedge turns toward it, that is, if you share the debt toward it, then you shall cut it off, otherwise you shall not cut it off. Whoever you cover with this hanger will fall in fear. When the enemy increases, worship, blow the trumpet and let me know, the enemy will be destroyed. If you play fast, it will rain, if you play fast, it will rain. And when you are on the throne, you will blow the trumpet to tell me that the king&amp;#39;s power will increase. You will key goodness with the tail of Kai-change-age, and you will walk according to that goodness. Wear his wings for good deeds, and your royal power will increase You will eat the head and the two boats, you will become very wise, and you will become a strong king and a mighty warrior.” Then he took the sons of Khunuban, king of Swarnadri, and Thustam, king of Bihugatri, as ministers, and taught them many principles Then, by the order of Indra, Khulung and Khunlai, with all their relatives, came down to a place of chaos in the tenth century AD (490 BC according to the Hindus). There are many different types of characters in the film, but the most important one is the character of the heroine. Dhritarashtra&amp;#39;s wife Kankati went out to die in the forest, including the origin of the Indra dynasty. On the way, Narada met them (the second type) and asked them, “Where are you going?” The women said, &amp;quot;We are the wives of the Kauravas, and we have come out to die in the forest because our kings have died in battle. Murrimuram</content>

<content>&amp;quot;Well, you must not die recently. You must now try to avenge your enemies,&amp;quot; said Narada. Narada told the women of the Kauravas to dig a pond and cover it with gold and plant flowers to decorate it. The women dug a well and did the same. There sat Narada, worshipped, and shot with mantras.He gave them arrows and bows The women surrounded the city of the Pandavas and defeated them. Then, defeated in battle, the Pandavas began to worship Krishna. Krishna came and said, Why did you fight with the women? They are your relatives, such as your daughters-in-law, aunts, etc., and they fight in their faces! It&amp;#39;s too bad for you. Therefore, send women like Draupadi and Rukmini to fight them, and you will know them. Then he arranged his chariot and sent out his wives, Rukmini and Draupadi, with bows in their hands. There are many ways to get a job in the field of architecture. There are many ways to get a job in the field of architecture Then, regaining consciousness, Draupadi came again and shot all the women of the Kauravas, including Duryodhana&amp;#39;s daughter, and threw them into the gem-land where the sages had previously lived. Then they regained consciousness and worshiped Narada again. Then Narada came and gave the women a mantra to worship the gods. The women of the Kauravas began to worship the gods. Dhritarashtra&amp;#39;s wife Kankarti became menstruating one day and on the second day she was killed by the side arrows day and night. Therefore, it is important to understand the importance of these two aspects of the universe. Then, when the two were united, Indra, the king of the gods, was freed from the curse and assumed his own form and went to heaven In time, Kankati gave birth to a son. When the child was born, the gods in heaven rejoiced and played many instruments, the fairies began to dance, the ten directions rejoiced, and the lakes became pure. These things, however, caused various fears in the mind of Kankati. The second day of the season Kankati was anxious at the birth of the child in her womb and began to praise Indra, O country! Your children are always sinful. O Devesh! It is not in my power to see your son, do whatever you wish. Hey</content>

<content>The beginning of the gods! O country! O lord of the wines, ! You will not doubt that this son of yours must be a wicked man. For this, O Devatanath! You are his father, your son, do whatever you want. O Lord of the gods! I have this desire, and no other desire. Indra says, O Kankati! Listen to my words. --This son will save your family. Under the influence of my husband, your son and his descendants will rule here for 128 generations, becoming the inhabitants of Sauma and becoming kings of Saumarakhand. Then they will surely become just, intelligent, zealous, devoted to the gods and brahmins, and all will go to heaven and merge in Vishnu for a time. With these words, Indra, the king of the gods, went to heaven. Kankati named the boy Dhenkham. When he grew up, Indra gave him a god called Chom Deo (or Chom Cheng, ) to worship, a hengdan to destroy enemies, a pair of drums for the tiger, two pairs of chickens called Kai-cheng, Mung, to see good luck, and much politics He taught them. Under the influence of these divine substances, Thenkham became very powerful and extended his kingdom to the Swarnadri and became king. In the Yogini Tantra, this thekham is referred to as &amp;#39;Adim&amp;#39; At that time there was a king named Dhunban, of the Sun dynasty, in Swarnadri, and with him was a scholar named Pujakriji. After a few days, one day Indra came and met them with Thenkham and said, &amp;#39;You shall appoint the sons of Khuttam and Khunban as ministers, and Laokhi and Puja, the sons of these two scholars, as ministers. They are the ignorant of Indra, the king of the gods. They gathered together and ruled as far as Swarnatri. - Then Kham Princess 18 people. First he had a son named Khun Lung, (Khun=prince, Lung, “great); then Khun Lai (Khun —prince, Lai=chief), and after him 18 more princes, bringing the total of Thenkham to 100 princes He made Khulung and Khunlai kings in the mountains. At one point, Indra wanted to send his descendants to be kings on the plains of the earth. Thenkham did not want to come himself and asked Indra to send his sons Khulung and Khunlai. Indra also became satisfied and sent Khulung and Khunlai down the golden ladder with the two brothers. They came and settled in Muri-Muram</content>

<content>After the flood before the days of the Ahoms, Brahma tried to save mankind three times. Then Sranjib could not say Lao. There was a man inside the pot, and he jumped out. They are like animals, they know nothing. Indra , the king of the gods , sent Mangal to teach him ; He came and taught and explained. But the people knew it and listened. In the true age, they had the same love, ate in the same maihang, and were all like sons of the same mother. The Treta Yuga went almost like that. There was a dispute in the Dvapa era. They are strong, and the strong win the weak. The Origin of the Indra Dynasty ( The Third Type) Then everyone saw this and prayed to Indra. Indra also asked his son Dhenkham to come to the plains of the earth with a large shield, sword, policy, staff, umbrella, leather, tangy, pain, gold and silver shields, and the animal of the temple, Kaicheng-mung. Then Kham himself refused to come, so he sent his two sons, Khunduz and Khunlai, down to earth with the golden ladder to make them kings They also came to Murishungram and stopped there. There was once a king named Khekham of the Tai tribe. He had no sons, only a daughter named Shyama. They are the ones who have been worshiping the god Indra since they were born When the princess was 12 years old, Indra, the king of the gods, was pleased with her worship and came to give her a gift. Indra stood before the princess at the place where she worshiped and asked her, “O princess! Why do you worship me so much? I am pleased with your worship and have come to give you a gift ; Tell me what you want. Then the princess looked at the face of Indra and was fascinated by his appearance. If you have come to give me a gift, please count my intentions. My father has no son to rule the kingdom. So I am very sorry that my father&amp;#39;s kingdom is destroyed. Therefore, let my descendants be increased from me to preserve the kingdom of my father Fulfill my wish by marrying me to a handsome man like you, who is strong, strong and virtuous. Hearing the princess&amp;#39;s words, Indra thought, &amp;#39;Where can I find a man as strong, as strong and as handsome as me?&amp;#39; Indra, the king of the gods, married the princess. and the city of Cheng-yung, where the princess was named the origin of the Indra dynasty (the fourth type).</content>

<content>Let the beginning remain. In time, in the womb of Indra, 100 sons and one daughter were born to the princess—the first son being Ai Khulung, the second Ai Khunlai, the third Longo, the fourth Lai, the fifth Lesai, 100 sons and one daughter respectively. From them all Asia, China, Syria, Korea, Manchuria. Lai-Yang, Lama, Tibet, Lhasa, Bhutia, Shan, Mukhong, Menchara, Lok-Khon, Lokong, Burma, half of Japan, parts of Nepal, Yodra and Assam sufficient Tai descendants increased. Indra sent Khun Lung and Khun Lai, the sons of the above-mentioned princess Shyama, to become kings on the plains of the earth. They also went down with the man and settled in Murimuram. The origin of the Indra dynasty (and a kind of *) Amlakhi, Ashvattha Rule. Some say that in the past, when the sage Bashishta wanted to build a holy place like Varanasi at the mouth of the river Dikhou, he wanted to name the river Bashishti and Ganga. He buried a thousand shalgrams in a place two krosas near the water in the southern country of the river, buried Lakshmi Narayan in the middle, and began to worship Kush and Tulsi around it. Then he commanded Mech, knowing that he would go to heaven. The clouds rain on the river increased, the ashram of the sage Bashishta Burai, the worship materials They were drowned. Then Bashishta, being angry, and meditating, saw the inaction of Indra, and cursed him, saying, Indra! May you be born in the womb of Mlech, so that you may become a god and do the deeds of Mlech. They also cursed the river, saying, &amp;#39;Mlechs will live in your wires. You will be a stool army; He that dieth upon thy shores shall be a dead man. Then Laxminarayan Shalgram, who was buried, was also picked up and said, &amp;#39;The Mlech kings will worship you with beef and pork and wine. Your name will be &amp;#39;Chong&amp;#39; in the Mlech language They will worship you in secret. Then, hearing the curse, Indra and Nadi fell at the feet of Bashishta and prayed for the curse. Then the sage was pleased and said to Indra,—You will live in heaven before by inseminating a woman of this Slech race, but you will take the body of Yech as a son. They say to the river, &amp;#39;Your curse will end after ten thousand years. Therefore, it is important to understand the importance of these two aspects of the universe. * From &amp;#39;Big Wheel Scissors&amp;#39;</content>

<content>In the days of the Ahoms, Indra commanded a learned man named Shyama, saying, O Shyama! Sage Vashishta has cursed me to hold a slash body. Therefore you are the wife of a king named Chentam in the mountains Keep being. I will conceive in your womb and come back to heaven. As a son, I will be king of Slash and rule the kingdom. Then, at the command of Indra, Shyama Vidyadhari married a beautiful wife named Padmini in the house of the king of Chengtam Nara It continued to happen. According to the Ahom, his name is Nangchuk-Than-Chen; His mother&amp;#39;s name was Kungde-man Kan and his father&amp;#39;s name was Changram. Then, when Chentam Nararaja went to kill the wolf, Indra disguised himself as his husband and inseminated Padmini. He will be a glorious king and his name will be Swarganarayana Thori. From this day on, you shall not go in with your husband until you have a son. Then when a son is born, he makes a golden ointment I will bring you down with the ladder you made and send you and your son to the plains of the earth. Then Indra went away. Then the daughter (Padmini) told the king of Nara about the orgasm and the dream. The king built a hut on the hill of Meenachal and carefully placed his pregnant wife and her maidservants. In due course the queen&amp;#39;s son was born. The king, too, rejoiced at the birth of his son· and brought down his wife and son by a ladder adorned with gold. They named their son Chakyachakya Then, in a dream, he received the command of Indra and named him Swarganarayana. The boy became virtuous, strong, and bright, and became a young king, and ruled the people in righteousness When his father Chentam died, he became an independent king. His descendant (after several generations) Chukapha Saumar was the first Ahom king. * The first of the above proposals for the origin of the Indra dynasty is as follows: [[30] The giant king Indra (or Land n) then Kham (or Arddim) (Lai in the womb of the beautiful giant Gri.</content>

<content>According to the first, second, third and fifth proposals, Gunulul-Khunlai proves to be the grandson of Indra, in whatever way and in whose womb, but according to the fourth proposal, they are both sons of Indra. Most histories (and folklore) refer to them as the grandsons of Indra. That’s why here They were considered to be the grandchildren of Indra. 12 The first explanation says that Khun Lung and Khun Lai came down with their relatives and settled in Murimuriram. Then one day the judgment of the Kai-Cheng era came. Khundung asked his brother when no one could say he was there. They say they forgot to bring it. Khundung was very displeased when he heard this and said, &amp;#39;Deo-kukur), there can be no coronation without a hat with its feathers. Then he told his brother to go back and get Kai-Sez-Mulk. Forgetting to leave, Indra is angry and agrees to leave, and falls to the ground A man named Khunlung told him that if he gave me the country of Kheh (China) as a reward for my suffering, I could go to Indra and bring Kaichengyung. Khuluz also sent Lango to heaven to fetch Kaisengmung, saying that he would give him the country. I need to They went and told Indra. Indra searched and saw that he had left behind the Kaicheng Yuga, the Hengdang and the big drums. After some rebuke to Khulung and Khun Lai for forgetting, Indra gave the three substances to Lajo and sent them away. Lango came and gave the three objects to Dhundunga, and told him that Indra was very angry that he had left them. Then Langor lied to Khundung, saying that Indra had killed Kaisengmung and told you to eat his flesh, to look at Mars with his tail, and to wear wings; They have given me the head and the two boats to eat. And when I heard that I was going to ask for the land, he gave me the Hengdan to take. Kheh, the country is a big country, and you can only conquer it with this Hengdan. He was surprised to hear this, because what Langor said was contrary to the previous command of Indra, the king of the gods. But if you don&amp;#39;t act accordingly, Indra knows Again, thinking that he was angry, he accepted Lago&amp;#39;s words as true and gave Lango the hangda with the country. He also killed Kaisengmung and ate it as he was told by Lajo and gave it to him. Then he looked at Mars with the tail of the sword. When they found one on Mars, they walked towards Khulung and passed it to the people. He found one on Mars, Dhundugar</content>

<content>In the beginning, he became a king, rode an elephant and filled his house with la-ligira. Then, thinking that he could subdue them all, he ordered two ministers (Khunban and Dhuptam Santuti) and his relatives to build a better and larger city in Murimuriram did it. When the city was built, he decided to make Khulung king and Khun Lai prince by establishing &amp;#39;Ayub&amp;#39; and &amp;#39;Batbar&amp;#39; at Murimuriram. Then the two brothers quarreled. The eldest says, &amp;#39;I can be king. The younger Khun Lai says, &amp;#39;I can be king. Then the Bailung devas gathered and asked, &amp;#39;Indra Deraja has forbidden you to quarrel. He&amp;#39;s doing well, who and where are you painting gold and silver in Ayurveda? Dhundunga says, I have painted the qualities of qualities and forms in the fire, I am the king who needs joy. Khun Lai had a wicked mind. He secretly wrapped 5 seers of gold in the root of the Ayub tree behind his brother. And he said to his brother, If there is any sign you have given on the root of Ayurveda, then you are the king of the root, or else you are Dulias. There was a disagreement between the two brothers about this Khun Lung says, I am the king. Khun Lai said, I am the king of the roots, you are Dulia, I have tied the roots of Ayurveda with gold. Then, just as Khun Lai had said, the roots of Ayub were covered with gold. Then the deity Bailung Pandit also said, Khulung! You are hanging on the branch, you are Dolurah, Khun Lai is hanging on the root, he can be king. Then he made Khun Lai king, and he became king, and began to betray Khundung with others. 13 So Khundung secretly stole Choshdeo and fled to Indra and told him all that had happened to Khunlai. Then Indra cursed the Gulai dynasty that he would not be king forever and ordered Dhundunga to become king of Mukhmunjao. Khulung came to Mukhmunjao country by order of Indra and ruled there for 40 years and divided the land among his sons. While Khulung was still alive, he made his first son Aigulung king of Taitungkong (or Mukong) and ordered him to send one million horses to Mukhmunjao annually. Lamunta (ie Jiutara) made his son Khu₹ king of the country and let him run three hundred elephants a year. Khun made his son Makrishna king of Yungjang (or Jun Lung) and paid him 100,000 rupees a year. He made his son Khula king of the country of Munkula and allowed him to continue to feed the waters of the Dihing.

<content>They made it a rule that the Ahom days should be held twice a year. He kept his son Khuku for his kingdom and made Lango king of Kheh as he had promised. Then Dhundunga died and Mukhmunjao died as king of Khuku in the same country after enjoying 25 years. After the death of Khukhu&amp;#39;s sons and grandsons, his son Chao-senchao ruled there for 19 years. His son Tyao Khunzao succeeded him as king. He died after ruling for 15 years and his son Tyao Khujun became king As mentioned earlier, Khun Lai betrayed Khulung and fled to heaven, leaving Lung Murimuram; and later became king of Mukhmunjao by order of Indra. After Khun Lung left, Khun Lai became king of Murimuriram. He reigned there for 70 years and eventually died but could not go to heaven because of his bad character He was succeeded by his son Tyao Ijepatat Fai, who ruled his father&amp;#39;s kingdom for 40 years. He was childless. Like Shankaditya&amp;#39;s Shak, this king began to rule the country under his own name, &amp;#39;IJP Lakbi&amp;#39;, or &amp;#39;Lenchong&amp;#39; Shak.

<content>Doesn&amp;#39;t Jayadeva become a lion? Let the skilled half of a cow-Brahmin surround it and live happily ever after. So Bengal sent Katki in place of our goat Fukan. 9 When the Dhekri Bhadi was brought, Hatishala Bartila, Rahuli Fukan and Lapeti Fukan were fortified around the Panchartva. They kept the guard in fear for eight days. They were given: 1 bucket of coarse rice, 1 bucket of fine rice, 2 buckets of kalamah, 4 buckets of jaggery, 2 seers of sugar, 7 seers of butter, 7 seers of garlic, 8 seers of salt, 4 buckets of oil 5, 2 coconuts, 10 handfuls of pan, 1 duck egg, accompanied. Then the lawyer of Bengal, with other things, the deer&amp;#39;s neck-rope, opened it to the run, and took the commander Majumkhi with him to attack Bajal Katki, and crossed the Brahmaputra. Earlier, the kingdom of Kamrup was slightly dominated by Muslims. Therefore, it is important to note that the Ahom kingdom was extended to Karatwa by the son of Syed Barakar of Rangamati Mara. It has already been said. When Mirbhusla learned of this, especially in the days of Azimkha, the Surada of Bengal, mentioned in the footnote to the 11th invasion, Sinkula began to clap his hands to attack the Ahom king. The Sinkulai crosses the Brahmaputra at Rajamati. There was no special road to Assam at that time. Mirmala cut down the forest at the hands of her army, and Rat Mokolai began to rise. The pier was cut and mowed more than three miles a day. Thus, with great difficulty, the Yogal army entered Assam. It was early yesterday. The Brahmaputra has dried up and killed the Bharataria. When it was difficult to lift the boat, the soldiers began to pull the boat. Our native people in Rat also learned that foreigners were coming to invade Assam and began to give them a little voice. But Mirbhushala was very patient. Seeing that he himself began to walk left and right, filled with these sorrows, his subordinates could not cause much illness or disturbance. Thus the Yogal army arrived at Shimlugarh. At that time, the fear of invasion was greater than in the West. This time, there were better forts in several places south than in the south. This fort of Shimlugarh was occupied by Mirzula for a long time. After taking this fort, he entered Kothd and saw the fortifications and tactics of the Ahoms. The fort was defended by about 2,000 Assamese soldiers. Seeing the approach of the Rogal army, they fled the fortress at night. Then the story goes to the city of Mirghrina Bazar, Garhwal. Seeing Mishala as Matai, O Singh Bargade left the kingdom and went to Karrap Charirorong. This is why he was called the fugitive king. Many well-wishers acknowledged the rytha of Birphula. It was during this time that Bibastha wrote a letter from Garhwal to the Emperor that he could fly the Yogal flag in his Pikis Magbat (the capital of China) during the film year.

When it fell on the earth, it burned, it fell on the mountains, and the mountains burned Both birds were also dead. Then, seeing Haptiyukha from a distance, one of the wise elephants said, &amp;quot;It is not good for us to stay in this place, and we must leave. One of the elephants said, &amp;#39;How can we leave this place?&amp;#39; If a bird approaches us, can&amp;#39;t we kill it with an elephant? While he was saying this, the two birds came together and fought. 3 148 Pikin Rogar to go to Parock Flaby, the gossamer ended his rice hut at Garhwal. In 1662, Baribai appeared in great expansion. The Brahmaputra itself flooded. There was a lack of fodder for the Akhabohi army that had come with the Yogal army, and the horses began to die without food. The horses were killed in droves, and there was no one left for the cavalry. When Jaidhwaj Singh Swargade heard of this, he slowly came out of the bird cage and began to persecute Yogal Sema. so that they might be eager to eat, and began to try the load. Fate also turned against the Muslims at this time. They were able to stir up the Muslim army in Shishir. They were the ones who fought against Bargadeo. There is nothing to eat. How do you know in battle? So in those who go to war. They&amp;#39;re dead. John also covered those who had stayed away from the battle. Mirjuli, unable to withstand the Ahom invasion, returned the captured kingdom of Kamrup to the Ahoms and went to Bhatimua. According to Sir WW Hunter Chahar, some of Mir Bhushal&amp;#39;s army flowed into Shivsagar, and many of the Muslims there had children with Mir Jumla&amp;#39;s army Some believe that when Jaidhwaj Singh Bargade came out of Charai Khoroz and attacked the Mughal army in an adverse situation, Bibankula proposed the Treaty of Vetia. Jaidhwaj Singh Bargade, who could not fight the Mughals and got the name “Bhagnia (King)&amp;quot; for nothing, now saw their condition and attacked them. What if it&amp;#39;s in good shape again? They agreed to the treaty, thinking that it should be done in the past. According to this treaty, Milai conquered the land under the control of the Ahoms from Bhati to Gargaon. And our Bargade is also an ally. 100 prisoners, 100 daughters, forty-five elephants, thousands of gold, thousands of silver, this is the dowry, which is given to a woman named Ramani to Basai. If the Muslims were killed, our king would fight the next time They say that they lost and agreed to make a treaty, but this is false. In fact, the Brihulans could not end this war and lost the country, allied with our market. The poet goes, stay in that friend. There are many ways to get away from these things.

When you come, you can serve the three Gohais and the Baharatma. History is also continuous. Then the two Katkis of the Kacharis said, &amp;#39;Our Hargeshwar has given sleep to the two Katkis of Ithai. Then the Barfukan said, We have sent two Katkis for Aiti; Your king did not send a guard with our two guards. Only your king will send a lawyer. Go to a bhahat first, and come back in the past. Then the two guards went and told the king about this. The king of Ridarsha also sent a letter with a letter to the king&amp;#39;s place. They’re They came to Satgaon. Then 40 men of the “Nan-Har” tribe from Satgaon came to our place. Therefore, the Kachari Katki is also a reverse story. This is why we were displeased with the Kacharis. After the meal, the king cooked ten shairas of hazabi and gave five shairas to the fukans of the court. Then our Bazad &amp;quot;put the Nam-Har people in the goat cage and made them play “elephant and death”. The Maharaja also picked him up, gathered the rest of the money, gave it to Jeli Syed Jakar, with our Chandrandali and Sanatan, and sent Chaira Jafar away. The Chaista or Nabar of Dhaka also sent a letter to Panditrai with Chandrakandali and Sanatan to the place of Bargarmaharaja. Chaesta khu Rachan also sent them here, saying, &amp;#39;The reason for the border you have mentioned is that Thatsare says it is the land of Kochvi. How can you get it?&amp;#39; Then the king, hearing this, picked up the scholar and gave him his tongue. Our Chala, Gandhira, these two Katki left Panditrai at the place of Rashil Ra in Guwahati. A few days later, Arjiu Patra of Delhi sent two Katkis asking for money for the remaining fifty elephants. And our king said, What is this?

The king&amp;#39;s men took this to Delhi. Therefore, it is important to note that the 14th century Muslim invasion of Kamrup was carried out by our Bargadevas, who were invaded by the Muslims in Kamrup. The Muslims look like war horses, and we are also brave. At this time, Barphukan came to Lati, the son of the famous Momai Bhalguli household in Kamrup. The king&amp;#39;s soldiers grew old with Barphukan on the ground. They were defeated and drowned. Our side of the border chased to whom it rubbed. Our service was not diverted from the river Jabah. That river was flowed and the boundaries of our country were defined.

Then the Maharaja, intending to capture Bengal, built a road from Teliadoza to Jatimukh to understand the movement of the people. Then he dug a pond at Khokora, and at Galpughat (now the ripe ghat of Shivsagar) we offered sacrifices to the great men, and gave them alms, and sent them away.

<content>f The Muslims invaded the 14th century and sent many men to capture Balak. The Maharaja heard that Syed Zafar was in Guwahati and was sitting in Lokvan Itakhuli in Bengal. Then the Maharaja They sent Lachit Barphum, son of Momai Bhamuli Barbarua, O Imela Fukan, Vera Fukan, Charidia Fukan, Jiri Sandikey Fukan, Laluk Fukan, etc., with the Bhangarias, including Khatan Buragohain of Bahgaria, to lay bricks. In the month of Bhadra, 1599, Dihingira Fukan went and attacked the fort of Bahubari, and found Chauran Beg and Kamal (some say, Lalbeg and Rochanreg, two thousand men); They found 12 horses, some sheep and goats. After the rice, he went by boat and broke the three faiyas of Kajli, Panikhati and Sonapur. Then the Oimela Nyayasodha Fukan, the four Dia Fukans, were shot in the bricks, and so was Lachit Barfukan; The Na-Fukan of Dihingia Sandhikai approached the north bank and fortified near the Tea Tower. Bengal captured a fort. Lanyai Abhaypuria Rajkhowa left the fort with a few men and captured Bengal. Bengal cut off Rajkhowa along with two or four of our men. From there he approached Itakhuli. From there he sent spies. He looked at the night and said, the fort is just south Fukan remained in the fort. Nare took 398 measures. To secure Guwahati, he built Saraighat and his father&amp;#39;s fort. and he made a census of the people and the land of the newly taken place, and established the rule of the kingdom in peace. When Sipile heard of this defeat and danger in Delhi, the arrogant Aurangzeb Pacha was humiliated beyond measure. The Mahasamaroh sent King Ram Singh, the ruler of Anbara, with a large army and nine famous warriors of the time, along with Senapati Bari, promising to conquer Assam in revenge for the Khaz. When we heard about it, we. Ambardhipati Ram Singh was duly caught in the arrangement of Dhuddha. They were ordered to go out to the Buddha with their Kari Pikes, and joined the great general Lachit Barphukan. Barphukan, with his wise growth, erected forts along the roads on the north, south and south banks, and entrusted separate officers with the responsibility of guarding the roads. His neat heart and fighting skills are the true picture of Ahom pride. The Muslim commander arrived in Assam with his army. But our burden has not been lifted to the extent of Barfukan&amp;#39;s wishes. Rice he thinks the war will somehow burn Chochor to Ratar.If he can nir, the Muslim can be given a buck again. These were the reasons for the invasion of Assam by Ram Singh. After a few days in the north-Ivory, Barfukanbe. The preparations and the fortifications were completed.

Hata Dwi soldiers crossed the river and swam to the pier of Ashwakrantha. My people dag| They gave it to him. Chairon and Barak and the others were broken. Our man stayed there. Four days later, Bale Nare Tare captured Assam. Then he could not stop at the Mair of Assam and withdrew. In the month of Ahin in 1590, the fear of Obahati was overwhelmed. Then Assam went and encamped at Manahamuk. They were captured by Assam, including Chaira Firoz Narar, Syed Channa, and Jeer Box. Baal also cut off the people of Biv. After the rice, our men reached Pahara Rank, son of Syed Feroz, and Syed Furshan fled from there. Our man Khankhana took what he had previously taken. They caught us and brought us. Rahuli and others who remained in Radal, Uddhar Dura, gave two old men with two armies. In these two battles, three Muslims attacked the Rao of our battle. But he turned his back on the answer. Bharanra came and attacked the fort of our Rangmahal. There are many ways to get away from these things, but the most important thing is to get away from these things. Meanwhile, Ram Singh had a quarrel with Rahid Khan and ordered him to cut off his tarik and leave. One night, when our Barhilai was shot in the fort of Rar Singh, Ram Singh&amp;#39;s nephew Bhangali was killed. Ramsingh sent for Rahid Khan to steal, but Zahid Khan could not go and he sent them away. Zahid Khai then heard his kothd singing. Seeing that Zahid Khan did not eat, Ram Singh thought that the Assamese people had already known Bahid Dhir Lagar. His vedia also he has set up a chapi fort in Assam. Betia Mahil was too slow to call in such a dangerous time, lest he was slowly preparing to join the enemy. Burning, thinking of it, immediately sent Bashir Bak to remove the fortress from the load. They sat down and ate the rice, and after being insulted by the morgatti, they returned to the country alone. But Bedio There was such ali and scratching among the Yogal soldiers that all our soldiers and officers obeyed Barphukan&amp;#39;s orders with heartfelt joy. Everyone had faith in him. A physical man who can perform Hajj, the vessel of the universe, with devotion to such an artificial being, the end of those who understand him, his merit is inevitable. His fame is everlasting. Coming to the base on the Caid side, Jupiter will get it if he dies somehow. The poet Kachi, who attacked Guwahati rather than Jeet, took form near Agiathuti with all his mind. Our Barfukar also understood the movements of the Muslim army. He knew that the authority of the city of Guwahati depended entirely on this old man. Therefore, it is important to note that the present study is not limited to the field of physics, but also includes the field of biology, chemistry, and physics-based research When Ria came to Bahau, she was married to the present Amindar, who was in charge of the fort.

After the rice, the spy Jelly Fukan Rajkhowa watched; And he said, Thus saith the LORD; You will keep watching the movement of Bengal. Then Patsar of Delhi sent Ram Singh, king of Aghar, with his army to kill Assam. When we received this message, we also prepared to fight according to the command. Then the king of the sky, Ram Singh Barphukan, said, &amp;#39;The fight is good only for the rainy season, so delay us in the battle.

The next morning it happened there. There was a fierce battle between the sides. Therefore, it is necessary to take into consideration the fact that the Muslims were not able to fight the Ahoms on the battlefield. Therefore, it is important to note that the present study is not a comprehensive study of the effects of these factors on the development of the fort. This old completely Khati Battle of Saraighat was greatly enlarged by Ram Singh to cross the fort by giving it towards Saraighat. This is the famous Kharaghat. The battle lasted for four months. There is no doubt that Shathit Barphukan was a wise general, given the battle methods, resolve and heroism of this key month. Barfukan&amp;#39;s Dih. Thak Kaushalab Gugat Barsingh began to fall unconscious in every attack. And finally his swim broke down.

<content>178 The days of the Ahom are not burnt. Its existence is to tell us. Therefore, it is necessary to take into consideration the fact that the present study is based on the results of the 2013 IEEE Transactions on Electrical Engineering (TEE) Conference held in New York, USA. So give Guwahati four. Otherwise, two Khriman Fujis can also tell and say, if there are not many shores in Assam, if you ask him, he can give you a share. Therefore, it is important to understand that these are the characteristics of the country&amp;#39;s economy. Therefore, it is important to understand that the country&amp;#39;s economy is developing rapidly. Therefore, it is important to understand that the country&amp;#39;s economy is developing rapidly How did it turn out? They talk about two Christian fighters, don&amp;#39;t you have the courage to fight for 2.4 years? And that he speaks of arrows and guns, eat one of them in his place; If it takes, we will be brought! But God has given us ; He can never be left to Bengal. Ram Singh, having received this solution, marched towards Gualkuchi; And on the way, he worshiped himself at the Madhav Temple in Hajo. Then Ram Singh, with many men, captured our Saraighat fort. The fight lasted for four months. Many of us fell in battle. But most of Bengal fell. Thousands of Bajals fell before the cannons of Assam. The rest of Ram Singh&amp;#39;s army was defeated. The Battle of Saraighat was won in 1 word, and Ram Singh was replied that he would not make a treaty. This is the attempt. Therefore, it is important to note that the present study is not only about the characteristics of the country, but also about the characteristics of the country&amp;#39;s economy. Although Madhavacharan took it upon himself before Ramsingh, he could not achieve his destiny by doing so. He knows the character of Barphukan well. Therefore, he became a tree until he mentioned to the patriotic and royal Barphukan what Ram Singh had taught him. All the schemes of Ram Singh also failed. Unable to defeat Barphukan by conspiracy, Ram Singh attacked Guwahati once again and learned the way of the teacher. This time he sent Charip, Khan, the commander of the army, by boat across the river to Obahan Sohar. Valezle kept a saven of it, and Barfukan immediately burned the shawl boots in the dark. Puti, rice Naga four walls in which sand filled • saved. The other officers were amazed at this wonderful technique of killing the fort. Seeing the Muslim warships crossing the barrier of our watery sea, Paniphukan ordered the Muslims to fire from both sides. Meanwhile, the boat reached the sandy beach of Ashi Azar. There is nothing wrong with a smile. There is nothing wrong with a smile. He told Bedia that the enemy giant had come and taken the pose of Asakalib, and that our river had not yet flowed. When he came out, he saw that Brihavan&amp;#39;s boat was approaching Guwahati, and he ordered him not to lift his salpiba at all, and there was an echo in the paradhas on both sides: There are many ways to get a job in the UK, but the most important thing is to get a job in the UK</content>

This time Ram Singh fought again. Then, not seeing the hope of crossing the fort straight to Saraighat, he dug under the bushes straight to Pandu, filled it with rice and salt, and tried to blow up our fort. Then our spy saw that Bengal had dug a hole in Pandu and told Barphukan. There are many ways to get a job, but the most important thing is to get a job. There are many ways to get a job, but the most important thing is to get a job. And it came to pass about an hour later, that the wall fell down at two o&amp;#39;clock in the morning. When the king saw that the wall was falling down, he was careless; Smoke started in the direction of Bahal The whole place was in a fog. The king saw no one anywhere. Then our men joined hands and built the wall. After the meal, Ram Singh again tried to cross the fort directly to Saraighat. Four Balals crossed the river straight north of Saraighat. Our men threw the knife and killed him. Bengal couldn&amp;#39;t stop and sighed. Again, the great banker of Rehar (Bharnath Kazi ) came and gave the fort straight to Lathia, straight to Kabaiguri.

In the four years from 1967 to 1671, this one brave man accomplished what the lives of thousands of Assamese might not have been able to compensate for. Lachit Braphukan was an Assamese of the time. He was old. They often fell into the trap of abhibanjan in describing the virtues of this Mahatma and it is not surprising that a strange legend about him was created among the Assamese after a few generations. All in all, there are various miraculous stories among the uneducated about the great men who especially capture the minds of the people. There is also a lot of controversy among the Assamese about the growth and heroism of Barphukan in Lathi. There was a generic issue. There is a legend to show the intensity of his growth that when the Muslims once invaded Guwahati, Barphukan led the men of Kalapatua, the same in hand, from the south of the river on the night of Asha. He insisted on lifting it, and not regretting the bullet of Brihaspaman, seeing the fearless Side of Kalapatua passing by, the commander of Brihaspaman feared that these were Irshal Vidya na kami men Marabi saints and they were going to catch Brihaspaman first. 6 stories of a Muslim commander fleeing Iraq.

Therefore, he secretly ordered the Charias to save Gadapani&amp;#39;s life. Gadapani was helpless when he heard this. How can he stand alone before the king&amp;#39;s mighty and numerous chariots? He had no choice but to surrender himself to the mercy of God with a wife like Saksha Sati and two princes like Ganesh and Kartik, and fled to the Naga Mountains in disguise Then Lararwa captured his beloved wife Jaymati, punished her, and chatted with Bukurachwa Chaoddai to find out about Gadapani. Despite her suffering, Jaymati did not tell her host. Gadapani somehow sensed his wife&amp;#39;s condition and came to the place where she was being tortured. He went to Jaymati three times. But he did not introduce himself. When he comes to the place of torture in Chaoralai, he runs away and looks at his wife in solitude and sorrow, but says nothing. When you vote, you will recognize Lorarza&amp;#39;s service, and the purpose of his life will be achieved. When he went to the third, the princess recognized him and told him that Gada was from that place He told me to leave. Gadapani thought back and forth, witnessing the moon and the sun, and from there he had to sing again. There is no doubt that Gadapani, an extraordinary hero, did not save his own life-giving Dida from such a plight. If his region had the strength, he would not have done so, but he showed extraordinary courage in doing so. for he saw that the maiden did not speak of him at all. And he introduced himself, the path of Ri Maharad&amp;#39;s practice is interrupted, but the great purpose of his life is immediately arranged. So he looked at the princess for the last time.</content>

Then the heavenly king built several fortresses at the Dollar Gate, intending to remove the Doflas from the burden altogether; and you cannot go down to the plains of Doflait did it. Then he was in great trouble at Doflai; And so they came in great distress, and came with many gifts, and took refuge in Vargadeva. The Mikirs also harassed the people of the plains from time to time for many days. That&amp;#39;s why this one! In 1687, Swargade sent our Dujjak army from both sides to attack the Mikir Mountains.

Because of his political experience, the influences of the country lived in peace and harmony in that ear. He was one of the greatest men who had frequently enjoyed the subject of Barrakara since the days of Bargade Prabhap Singh, in politics and in other words, the chief prince. Sadly, however, the signs of his history-burning infamy cannot be removed from his life character.

There, after making many inquiries, Jesse found some of them traitors and closed the office, and from that day on, he increased the number of the council of Barrakara and took Tajon with him Later they were called Tajon-Dhara Sandikeys. They have nothing to do with the Sandiky, and from that day on, the Bargadev Khabhave took a big japi to hold on to the top of the fort and roofed the pot with a top-like noise in a panichora.

Hate was very happy to hear this. For if the Mahant saw that he could help Mohanmaladev and make him king, he would be able to avenge the previous insult, and Abhi would become the favorite of the royal household and the top of all the greats. And where the majority of the intellectuals and chief officers of the country are followers of Mohanmaladev by heart, he will surely become king. Therefore, it is necessary to take into consideration the fact that the country&amp;#39;s economy is developing rapidly and the country&amp;#39;s economy is developing rapidly. Then the Mahant made a plan to gather his disciples together. He told all the devotees to build a foundation with a piece of soil for each man. We&amp;#39;ll take the cannabis. Then the disciples of the Mahant built a great foundation in that way. It is still called “Barbhet” today. and on that foundation the Mahant later established himself. All the disciples of the Mahant gathered to lay the foundation. The Mahant held a good wedding and invited Mohanjalader and the chief officers of his party and his friends and relatives. All the invited people (especially Mushali Bargohai and Bhagi Buragohai, another chief officer) went to the wedding. And the multitude of the disciples of John was gathered together.

And I hear that Mohanmala Kakaide is now in the same group as the Moammar Mahant. There are many disciples of that Mahant, and I have heard many of their praises. However, there is a special future that the disciples of the Mahant will hate as the same group of followers of Mohanmala. So we better be ready for it.

Therefore, it is your mistake to want to be respected like the Mahant of Dihing. Therefore, the authorities of the four satra could not call any more. Then the king fell ill outside the temple. There are three people, especially three, who will succeed him on the throne There was a disagreement between Dangaria and Barbaroa. There were two opinions in the minds of some officers, such as Kichidra Barbarua, especially among the three gentlemen and Barrakara.

Na-Gosai (Pasriya. Gogai) 3 Laxmi Singh Bargader was 55 years old when he took the kingdom. Especially when the throne was taken from Barrakara, Bargade left almost all the royal affairs to Kirdinj Barrakara, and Ramananda Pushpacharya was saved, and the other great men did not like the status given to him.

In fact, this is the main reason for the rebellion, and if the rebellion is won, the Mahant is also said to have succeeded Yohanmaladev to the Ahom throne.

But our brother-in-law Iraq wrote that some Hindustani fakirs are being brought in by traitors to Krishna Narayan to destroy the country. The Hindustani people are subjects of the British Government. Therefore, in 1714, the Governor General sent Captain Oles Chahar with some troops to prevent the British from entering Assam and committing violence. The captain came up with his army; and he took special care at first to prevent the Hindustani people from coming to this country and harassing it; But those Hindustani did not come to our country through Goalpara but started entering our country through the country of votes in the north.

Therefore, it is important to note that the name &amp;quot;Chudipha&amp;quot; is only a translation of the word Chandrakant Singh in the Ahom language. He was only about 13 years old when he became king. When Purnananda Buragohain, the Rajamantri Bhalriya, took him to the throne at Barchara, he was very afraid. His brother Kamalesh Singh became the Bargi, and all the chief officers of the country resided at Barchara. There is commotion in the kingdom, one king has passed away, another will remain on the throne, joy and sorrow are present simultaneously.

The king When he saw that Rudhagohai Bharia&amp;#39;s son had gone, and that he had no power to give the king his rights, even if he did not give it well, he slowly released the scepter from the body of Charibbia Fukan. But the Bargade was so fond of Satram Fukan that they sent him away with great oaths, begging him not to kill him when he was brought from the roof. When the fourth Fukan was released, Rajao Deuta and other well-wishers were convinced that no more persecution would happen to the king. Sabram Charidia Fukan was brought to the square and his traitor Bidaf was brought there with him. “Everyone gets angry when they see a hala tree,” said many of his companions in his council, seeing the danger of Charidia Fukan, and not hoping that he would have a time of wealth again They began to press him forward. During the trial, the other Goat Fukans sat in the seats, but he objected that there was no rice seat in the Nishite of the Charingia Fukans. Then it was explained to him from the assembly that he was now a traitor and therefore unworthy of the seat. And the testimony was testified against him and his companions. Many of those who were initially associates of Satram Charinia Fukan testified against him.

<content>Chandrakanta Singh persecuted the people of Kamrupi; They even made an elephant named Ralakdas in Guwahati drunk and released him into the city; And they rejoiced at the harm that the elephant had done to the people. In addition, when he re-issued the order “no one should stay inside the city of Guwahati if it is smelly” when he came as Barphukan for the second time, the people of Kamrup became very hostile to him. Therefore, it is important to note that the present study is not a comprehensive study of the history of the country. Now it’s on the other side Therefore, it is necessary to take into consideration the following factors: There were five sons of Purnananda Buragohain: Bandhana Lorigohain, Kachinakh (later Buragohain), Premnath (later Ghartnikhwa Gohain), Oredhanath (who became Dhekyal Fukan) and Jagannath (who became the subject of Naoshalira Fukan). The eldest of them (ie Parigohain) married Maju Aideu, sister of Chandrakant Singh Bargadev. But God did not allow Aideu to spend her days happily with him. They both disagreed and Aider left his brother and went to his brother Orekhanath Dhekial Fukan. Then Oredhanath Dekial Fukan did not marry. After Maju Aideo joined him, he married Pijou Aideo, daughter of Ram Barphukan. Therefore, it is important to note that the present study is not limited to the field of physics, but also includes the field of biology, chemistry, and physics. Now, seeing that Buragohain Dazria had won on all sides, the king They gave their opinion on the arrest of Barfukan. These were done very smuggled. But by chance everything reached the ears of the Pijou girl. The young woman saw her father&amp;#39;s impending danger and wrote down everything. It is also said that Bargder&amp;#39;s sister Maju Aider wrote to Barphukan to arrest him, whether to insult him for the violence of his wife or for other reasons. I&amp;#39;m not sure who wrote the letter. The letter was stamped with the subseal of Dhekyal Fukan, so Barfukan believed it. 1 Some say that Chandrakant Singh Bargade felt greatly humiliated for marrying Pijou Aideo with great ceremony and conspired to arrest and punish Barphukshan.

<content>Before the days of the Ahoms, they wanted to enter Barphukan by writing letters, but for some reason they refused to bring Barphukan. It is said that Tulsi Aidekhe conspired to write the letter to Barphukan, but it is not clear what her intention was. There is no doubt that the root cause of this action is fear. The battle of Ramraran, at the heart of which is the Gita; Shurpanakha; Draupadi is at the heart of the battle of Kurukshetra; And like Helen in the famous Trojan War in Greece, the main actress of the Ahom life-evening play was either Pijou Gavru, or Maju Aideo, or Tulsi Aideo, daughter of Gaurinath Singh Bargadeo, originally these three. Anyway, Barfukan got everything quickly. He had already feared the fall of Charidia Fukan; Now, having received the letter, Barfukan was immediately confused. The king&amp;#39;s men in the evening to arrest Barfukan They reached Guwahati. Someone from the king&amp;#39;s side told Barphukan everything. Therefore, it is important to understand that the present situation is not the same as the previous situation. Therefore, it is important to understand that the present situation is not the same as the previous situation. And they all agreed with him. Therefore, it is necessary to take into consideration the fact that the present invention is not limited to the field of physics, but also includes the field of physics, biology, chemistry, and physics. There was a trial in the night, and it was revealed that Barfukan had fled with Janmi and Piali. Then the Buragohain found out everything. According to his composition, Ghanshyam Ghanshyam Barphukan of the Dihingia clan became Barphukan. Therefore, it is important to note that the present study is not limited to the field of physics, but also includes the field of biology, chemistry, and physics. Badamchandra Barphukan, however, left the kingdom under the king of Assam without any hindrance Rab Badan Barphukan thus fled. Ghanshyam Barphukan&amp;#39;s men also chased him away, playing with children. But he is lucky. No one could arrest him within the borders of Assam. He entered the British Empire without hindrance. He was pursued by Maheshwar Parbatira Fukan of Rasedra&amp;#39;s house with the help of Parashuram Duraria Barua of Bengalhat and went to Rajaldesh, and at Chilmari received the invitation of Jan Fukan They tried to catch him. But when his sons Janmi and Pirali went and reported it to the Chilmari Khana, the Thamar daroga kept it with Barphukan; This is because the Ahom do not have the right to market rice. Then Maheshwar, the brother-in-law of Ghanshya Barphukan, returned from Chilmari with Parbatira Fukan. Roy Chandra Barphukan also went to Calcutta in the same direction. Story.

The Butitish government then had a rule of &amp;quot;not to interfere in the affairs of the people&amp;#39;s state. Therefore, the General of the Government rejected Badan Chandra Barphukan&amp;#39;s prayer. Barfukan became disappointed and confused with the British Government. At that time an agent or officer from Burma (or Brahma) came to Calcutta. Badan Barphukan heard the news from R. and went to him. The Barfukan slowly told the officer about the plight of the country (probably to expel him). The Burmese officer promised to help Barphukan; and he took Bdan Barphukan out of there to the Man country for the sake of the military wall, rather than to defend the Man (or Brahma) country.

Of course, people from other nations came along with them; However, there were many more people who identified themselves as “Roma” than those who identified themselves as “Mian”. Therefore, the word “Yian” became known among our people as “Man” and the soldiers who came with Barphukan. Radan Chandra Barphukan, with about six thousand troops, came north through the Jagang and Mankong Chang and Jankai mines, gathered some more troops at Rat, and in 1736 crossed the Patkai Mountains and entered the borders of Assam. Arriving in Assam, Badan Barphukan collected another eight thousand neras. The Buragohain sent an army to fight the Janas.

<content>The Ahom days gradually found it very difficult for him to feed these armies. He thought of ways to increase his wealth, to expand his kingdom, and to plunder the land. This lot made Assam the poorest of the poor in India. Our knees are black when we remember the oppression of this lottery; but our fathers endured it. Then Mingimaha Tilwai decided to divide the army into places. Until then, only the southern part was under the Mans, towards Kamrup, Tilwai had not reached out. Now he divided his armies into three parts, one part on the north bank of the Brahmaputra, one part on the south bank, and one part through the Brahmaputra, and began to conquer Assam. Wherever they came, there was a plague in the land. They plundered the people&amp;#39;s money and killed others. But this was a lottery; This time they were very eager for people&amp;#39;s money; They did what they could with the money. He loved his life and gave up his wealth, and he escaped; He who had no money, or who did not give it out of love, does not tell of the pain he suffered. Bill could not escape if anyone ate anywhere. They were able to smell the fire and kill everyone they found. Therefore, it is important to understand the importance of these issues. Therefore, it is important to understand the importance of these issues. Therefore, it is important to understand the importance of these issues. But the Mans could not escape this time. The villagers did not hesitate to gather in places and drive away the children and women. The Man army, which was drowned by the Brahmaputra, found people on the banks of the river in Majuli and committed great atrocities. The flock on the north bank settled there and accepted the submission of the Mans and survived. The southern herds destroyed the southern bank of the Brahmaputra. There are many ways to get a job They’ve run away, that left the pair They also gathered whatever they found inside the houses. Gradually, the place where Chandrakant Singh was staying approached Guwahati. USE Chandrakant Singh gathered some troops with heaven when he heard that the two countries were coming from the south. These armies were the first to arrive in Guwahati He tried hard to drive them away; But seeing that the Manchu army was too numerous, Swargadeo slowly took a boat and went towards Bhati. Then the heavenly gods fled</content>

<content>Our army, knowing that Yogeshwar Singh, began to flee, and the Mans found it easier to capture the city of Guwahati. There are three men. Together, they became chooser again. They plundered the people in the temples, the monasteries, the temples, the gold and silver vessels on the rolls shooting shooting eroded or took There is also a golden urn on the banks of the Shivsagar Pond in Rangpur, which is still on top of the Shivsandir. There is a legend that when Mane shot it, Vedia said that the men who shot him died of bloodshed, so Mane could not take the urn. The USS and a group of men chased the king Chandrakant Singh. Our men were shipwrecked and all gathered at Hadarachki in Bengalhat. There is a Duwaria Barura named Bhat Haliram ( he is the father of our “Anandaram Dekial Fukan ; he was given the title of &amp;#39;Dhekial Fukan&amp;#39; by Swargade Chandrakant Singh during his second reign There was a great battle between the British and the Mans, but the Mans were able to win the battle with 34,000 soldiers Therefore, it is necessary to take into consideration the following factors: They also plundered the two houses they had left behind when they arrived. These atrocities were unbearable to all There are many sources of information about the country&amp;#39;s economy, including the country&amp;#39;s economy, the country&amp;#39;s economy, and the country&amp;#39;s economy.</content>

<content>2. There are many examples of these characters in the Ahom era. They put it together. Jabar also joined the Mans and began to rape many of them in various ways. People became restless. Therefore, it is necessary to take into consideration the following factors: Therefore, it is necessary to take into consideration the following factors: Then the Man commander Mizimah Tilwai saw this arrangement and wrote a letter to the British Government asking them not to help Chandrakanta and Purdar Singh. David Scott, Shahab was the Commissioner of Kochbehar at that time. He had already been very attentive in informing the Government of how the Mans should manage Assam. The Government, knowing the atrocities of the Mans and the plight of our country, ignored the letter of Jingimaha Tilwa. Therefore, it is important to note that the present study is not only a study of the characteristics of the country&amp;#39;s economy, but also of the characteristics of the country&amp;#39;s economy. Even the weakest people become very strong in time. The same thing happened to Chandrakanta Singh Swargadeo. In this battle, Swargade himself became the chief commander, promising, “Hato ba prap, syate swargang jitva ba bhujjate mahing”. This time the Mans could not fight much in this morgue of Swargadeo. After cutting and killing many Manks, Chandrakant Singh Swargadeo came up. But the pace of time is uneven ; He who is against yogurt cannot do anything. Vehicles of the country Already Mingimah There are many new Mansen under a commander named Bandula It&amp;#39;s arrived. In 1743, he fought with this army at Mohgarh. Nowadays, the mouth of the fort is called Kokilamukh. Then the salt and gunpowder of the great falcon died; Therefore, the Maharaja was defeated in the battle. The Maharaja&amp;#39;s army was about half a thousand They cut it off in traffic. Yanke Wherever they found them, including the Hindustani soldiers, they were cut with guns, cut with swords, and paid the due reward for coming to fight abroad and take the country. The Mans never forgot the lessons they learned at the hands of Chandrakanta Singh Bargade in this battle of Hohugarh. Many fled in that push. Some of them</content>

<content>They pursued him with the intention of catching Yogeshwar Singh Bargade; But they could do nothing to Barganer because they had lost their salt and pepper in the battle of Baigarh. Swargadeo entered the British Empire without any hindrance. The battle of Mahagarh saw the defeat of Chandrakant Singh Bargade and Purdar Singh Bargade had no choice but to fight. It was during this battle of Jahugarh that the Mans learned that they would not have rice in Assam for many days. And if there is to be another battle like this in one place, they are from Assam They&amp;#39;ll get up. Thinking this, the vehicles that were after this battle began to persecute them. The people also surrendered to death. They also began to kill with whatever they could find. On the north bank, before, Mane was not very reluctant to make an alliance with the king of Daral. But this time forget about that, there. It took a while. The Prabhas also joined the nearby Abar and Doflarila and began to kill Yan wherever they found him. “Alpanampi Rakhanang Sanghati: Karyasadhita” This combination of the people prevented the Mans from pushing their heads to the north bank at all. Everyone thought that the Mans had now been driven away. Therefore, it is important to understand the importance of these issues. Therefore, it is important to understand the importance of these issues. &amp;gt; Meanwhile, the Mans, not to mention Yogeshwar Singh Swargadeo, became intolerant of the oppression of the Jabar Barbarura of Dhamati. Then he broke the Barbara of Jabar and appointed Bhadra Chandra of Baktial as Barbara again. He killed Chandra Barbarua and the Buragohai of Kalir for distrust (2nd Baru), and appointed Rupeswar Buragohai of the Tepartalia clan as Buragohai in his place. Then the Mans came and crossed the north bank. This time, the wooden and bamboo walls were broken and Manaite lived like a snake in Meor, doing whatever he could. There is nothing wrong with that torture. The heart trembles when I remember it. This time the whole north bank was crowded. The Mans had already occupied other parts of our country and this time they occupied the north bank, giving them complete control of Assam. Chandrakant Singh was also watching the movement of the Mans from Bharepara. When he saw that his human fortune was fading, he decided to take refuge with the Mans again. He thought that from the beginning Mane had shown Mijanga with him, and they were not his Baja Bhada. Rather, they are to give him his kingdom if there is no vector</content>

<content>He took the home and sent for him: fearing that he had saved the journey Yogeshwar Singh in Ragal. If Adek takes refuge in the middle, he cannot be harmed. Instead, it brings profit. The Mans knew something and went to jail and saved him again. These seven or five loads, Bargader first secretly sent to Rupeshwar Buragohain Bhalbia telling everything. There are many ways to get a job in the UK, but the most important thing is to get a job in the UK There are many ways in which you can improve your self-confidence. There are many ways in which you can improve your self-confidence. But his hopes were not fulfilled. Tilora gave him the kingdom again, and ate the supply at Rangpur. Then, knowing that Rupeswar Buragohain had given Chandrakanta Singh a stomach, he fried him as Burhagohain with the Yogeshwar Singh clan and made Kalishan Burhagohain of the Teparbhalia clan; Therefore, it is necessary to take into consideration the fact that the present study is not a comprehensive study of the history of the country. The battle at Mohgarh, who Some say that after the battle, Mingimah Bandul returns to Mandesh; and how Tilora had invaded Assam, and went to the king of Man. Some say that Bandhula stayed here and was sent to Mandesh in 1745 by Dilowar and MiYimaha Kadeng Magatan Nayeb appointed a commander in his care. Some say, Bandul Here he was re-establishing the kingdom of Enst. Bandula is proof that not all the Mans were vampires either. Bandula was a Mu-ruler. He tries his best to restore what Tilora has destroyed. From the time of Ralula, the Mans were actually interested in governing, at least for a while, rather than plundering the country. and he restored their officers to their offices, according to their offices, and appointed judges and officers, as at the first. They did not attack the Mans and did not punish the natives. But when the natives attacked the Mans, they gave him proper peace. When you give peace, the plane can be fierce, the rice is the same He didn&amp;#39;t consider it. Most of the criminals were killed by cutting their stomachs. They cooked the criminals in such a way that people still think of them as black.

<content>Among the good people with Yogeshwar Singh, Baj took the kharmuri of Apaikan Chamua and the powmuri t of the Paikams, as money. Before this, the Mans did not charge any taxes or tribute. 836 Earlier, when Chandrakanta Singh Bargade, defeated at the Battle of Mahogarh, entered the British kingdom of Guralpara, Tilwai wrote a letter to the British in threat. David Scott, the Commissioner of Kochrehar, who was occupying Mane in Assam at that time, stationed a contingent at Guralpara under the command of Lieutenant David Chan Chahar. When Davidson received Tilwa&amp;#39;s threatening letter, he sent it to Scott. In the letter, Tilawa wrote, “We have an army of 18,000 warriors under 40 kings; It is the desire of all our subjects to keep alliance with the Company, and not to go to the limits of the Company&amp;#39;s kingdom. But if King Chandrakanta Singh is given shelter, we have received orders from our King to arrest him by force from wherever he is in the kingdom of the Company. On receiving this letter, Scott sent it to the Governor-General and wrote that the Mans were growing stronger, and probably themselves Soon they&amp;#39;re jokers. Lord Hastings was then the Governor General of India. He received Scott&amp;#39;s letter and ordered the British commander in Dhaka to give him whatever assistance he requested, and that if the Mans entered their kingdom, they would be forcibly driven out. I mean, when he found out, he didn&amp;#39;t dare to go there anymore. The occupation of the north bank increased the Manchuria. They thought that the country of branches, Assam, could be taken when who asks the little Kachar and Manipur! With this weight, they slowly began to reach out. &amp;quot;Sin in greed, death in sin – in this greed and sin their days drew near. Charjit Singh was king in Kachar at that time. He was afraid and told the British Government that his kingdom was being invaded by the Mans The Manchu commander refused to attack Kachar, but the army of Ayvar began to advance from all sides to the British border On an island called &amp;#39;Chahpuri&amp;#39;</content>

<content>They captured the British against the Ahom Din Man. The British had not dared to touch the lion for so long, but now they did. The British lion roared. Garb was Governor General of Amherst at this time. He ordered the apte of the Mans in 1746 (1824). The planet went towards Jainta, Chahar and Walpara and Memrin Sahib took Lena and surrounded the Mans on 12 March. I mean, they started running away from the agreement. The Mans who were in Guwahati fled on 28 March on hearing the news of the arrival of the British. This escape increased the atrocities of the Mans more than ever. They cut off the guilty and the innocent wherever they found them, and fled for fear of their lives. Scott, Chaharai, therefore, chased the Mans there and entered Nagaon. Seeing the rain ahead, Memrin Chahar went to Guwahati. Scott left a commander named Horschabara in Nagar with the intention of meeting Memrin and went to Guwahati on 15 April. The Mans fled the Nagas and reached Kaliabar on the land where Scott and Sahab came. Hearing that Scott had drowned, and that there were some troops under Horsbara, the Mans decided to attack Horsbara. Meanwhile, Captain Richards, Sir, went to meet Horsbara with new troops from Guwahati. I mean, he went to Rajligarh as soon as he heard of the arrival of the new army. One day there was a little fight between Richards and Mane; The Mans were defeated and fled. They are the ones who have oppressed the people of Assam in the past, and God is now paying them back When the Mans fled, the British chased them and stabbed them with their bayonets. That is, one day again, Richard attacked a place called Hatbar. They are the same as before ; Two parts were cut off, one part drowned while crossing the Kalang River. This time, from defeat, Mann went to die. They didn&amp;#39;t have an army of finances there. It was only when our people saw the trouble of the Mans at the hands of the British army that they realized how much they were fish in the water. Our Prabha also now began to catch them. Thinking of the British army as the speaker, our men began to help them as much as they could in all matters of food and drink. When Captain Orelus went north of the Sahar and burned the Manchu fort, the Manchu were on the north side of the river; They weren&amp;#39;t very dominant on the other side.

<content>Yogeshwar Singh became the subject of the British. Suddenly, at that time, Memrin Chahar died, and the vehicles began to descend from Jaramukh again. But this time they have not come to take possession of the land; They came to gather what they had plundered and to fill the gaps. After the death of Mr. Makrishin, Richards became the commander of the army of Mr. Makrishrin. Hearing that the Mans were coming again, he himself took some troops and went up the Brahmaputra. and sent some troops to Nagaon through the Kalang. The name of the British army caused the Mans to stir like locusts again. This time the Mans fled and the atrocities committed in Nagaon, Nagaon People will never forget him. The area between seven miles from the Purani Gudam Bhati is called Karrigaon. When the Mans fled, they built a &amp;#39;jaki&amp;#39; in this Kakhrigaon. This is the first time that I have seen a guy with a smile on his face. I have seen a guy with a smile on his face. Scott, the inhuman brutality of the Glencoe massacre or the &amp;#39;blind well&amp;#39; murder is not equal to this &amp;#39;Jackie&amp;#39; The jacket was held inside a house. They put up two good bamboo sheds inside, and filled them with whoever they could find, and drove them away from the outside, and put them in the house. The Mans were guarding the house with tazons in their hands. They caught the two who thought they were running away and threw them into the burning furnace!! H does the unbroken flame of fire. The miserable creatures began to slap, grab, and slap. How long can they be in the heat of the blazing fire? In a moment, the innocent creatures cried out, &amp;quot;They burn us without cause. Who will save us?&amp;quot; etc. The sky-breaking cries fell silent. Their bodies were burnt to ashes!! The poet was desperate to take up the rightful occupation. A month after the murder near Kadharigaon, huhu this fake all around in the evening “burns unnecessarily oi.” etc. were always rooted. I can&amp;#39;t say what this means. Perhaps for the sake of the death of those creatures, the neighbors heard them for a long time, and they seemed to be crying out every moment. 028 The &amp;#39;claim&amp;#39; of this neighboring village was fulfilled, and Pavant began to flee.

On the spot, he took the baby from his mother&amp;#39;s arms, appeased Maru, broke the head of her baby in the coconut tree before her, and began to tear her like a star. They began to take some of the Virovas with them. In some places, they set fire to villages and burned them down!! It is too much to write about the plight of our country at this time due to such cruel behaviour. In short, the wealth, lives and vehicles of the people were not stable at that time. Agriculture, trade, industry, almost all activities were suspended. Many people were forced to abandon their beloved sons, wives, daughters, etc. for fear of the Mans; and many have fled abroad for their spoil, and for their lives. Therefore, it is important to understand the importance of these issues. Therefore, it is important to understand the importance of these issues. The descendants of many people who fled our country during this period are still found in various parts of Bengal The inhuman oppression of our people during the reign of the Mans was not only committed by the Mans. There were many wicked men in our country who were disguised as Mans and caused many troubles. They were later called &amp;#39;Dowania&amp;#39; by our people. &amp;#39;Dovany. They were more prone to oppression than the real vehicles. They came suddenly, robbed the people, and harassed them in various ways. The main objectives of the Mans were to conquer the country, gather their food, and earn money. But these cruel &amp;#39;Dovanias&amp;#39; succumbed to the enemies of violence and greed and oppressed the people. A good book can be written about the life of a person or a family of this period. Our country was almost deserted under the Manchuria. The people wondered when God would save them from this practice. However, the Yans would have fled from Jaramukh at the name of the British army, but the army of Bichards and Sahar began to pursue them on foot; And let our men who are fleeing in the forests come out slowly one by one.

<content>Yogeshwar Singh Mingibah In the people of Kardeng Bagaun, in our country, Han Yanb Fukan was an officer by the name of Nam and Bagli, and above all was the &amp;#39;Old King&amp;#39;, Syadhyaksha, O Syam and Baglikukam. When our men came out of the forests and began to help the British army, the Vedia ships disappeared. In times of trouble, people lose their minds. There was a quarrel among themselves because of their great sin. They began to blame each other. Therefore, it is important to note that the present study is not a comprehensive study of the history of the country. Richards, the army of Sahar took advantage of this self-conflict and drove the vehicles away. They fled to Mamai and reached Jorhat. The British army camped at Gauri, the last battle of the British army. Manaite put two in the fort of Jorhat and fled to Rangpur. Richards, Chahar, heard of it and sent an army against them. The Mans were with this army on 29 January 1826 (1747) near Gauri Sagar. There is a battle. The Mans were completely defeated in this battle. The British Sema reminded them of the atrocities committed against our people and cut them with spinach. The Manchu armies were scattered when the treaty was proposed; And there were two divisions among their commanders. Shyam Fukan and Bagli Fukan agreed to move; But others say that he fights. However, according to the two chief Fukans, it was finally Lee. Shyam and Bagliphukan sent Katki to Richards and Chahar to make a treaty. Richard , seeing the difficulties of the times , thought it imperative to take this opportunity ; For if the standard cannot be driven out of sight at all, the main purpose of the state of a country is achieved; There may also be shortages of salt and foodstuffs. Richards, fearing this, agreed to the charge of the treaty. Sambit decided that he would stay in Manait and do nothing in this country. Those vehicles that want to return to Burma should go. Let those who want to stay in this land speak in peace in this land. In translating the effects of this treaty into action, a Buddhist priest named Dharmadhar Brahmachari was particularly helpful. He was a native of Nar or Sinhala, and grew up in the city of Ara in Thak Esbes. and in that Sabar he was the commander of the British army under the reserves, the tea.

<content>After the Ahoms left, about two thousand Mansena returned to Mandesh with about a thousand of our indigenous women whom they had destroyed. The feds stopped at the edge of the mountain. They didn&amp;#39;t leave our country at all. There is a legend that the Manaites began to take about thirty thousand Mahuhu from this country to their country. But the British army could not do that as it advanced, yet, in addition to the thousands of Tirovas they had destroyed the nation, the sages and women took four or five thousands of Mayuhs. Seeing the plight of our country, the mountain tribes like the Singpho and Ramti also began to hate violence. When the Mans were in our country, especially the Singphourila, they occasionally took advantage of our people and oppressed them. There are about 7,500 chingfou gotkhai in Sadiya They invaded the kingdom of the Gohais and the land of the great general of the Mataks. Both Sadiakhwa Gohai and Senapati sought the help of the British, who agreed to help them. The Mans who remained in the country joined the Singphous, and gradually prepared to invade the country again; Their venture, however, was no longer successful. Scott, Sir, paid special attention to the preservation of peace in the country; and sent some troops with Captain Newbill against the Singphous. Newbill Sahib went and drove the Singphous out of the Matak kingdom and Sadia and burnt the Singphou villages around Bichar. Seeing this, the Mans, seeing that they could not be stunned, fled our country altogether; and the Tsingfao are also subject to the British. He admitted it. Then the General made a treaty with Mr. Newbill, in which, at the end of the treaty, the General acknowledged the British, and agreed to leave Assam in order to place the northern part of his country in the service of the Pike British Government; acknowledges the submission of the Tsingfao ; The treaty of the great general Chandrakanta Singh Bargade was also at Rangpur at that time; Yogeshwar Singh Bargade was also in Jorhat with Shyam and Ragliphukan. Scott, seeing that they were almost in the same place, sent them away, fearing another mutiny. Yogeshwar Singh died in 1747 at Yogikhopa. Chandrakanta Singh remained in Guwahati.

<content>He sent some troops by sea to Burma (Ra Mandesh) under the leadership of Yogeshwar Singh Sir Achir and Campbell. The British army suffered from the rainy season and the shortage of food. But the pain did not last long. New supplies strengthened the armies. The commander of these armies was Milimaha Bandula. The history of Burma shows that he was a wise, multi-faceted and courageous hero. The Bandula commander and his army lived in the city of Donabyu on the banks of a tributary of the Irrawaddy. The British general Sir Archibald, Mr. Campbell, built a fort at Henzada near Donabu and fought in 1825 (1747 AD). In the battle, Bandula was killed by a cannon shot; and the British army won. The Mans fell in the battle. In 1824 ( 1748 ) there was another battle at a place called Pagan. There, two thousand British troops defeated and drove back eighteen thousand Manchuria. The British army pursued the Manchu army to Yandabu. The Manchu king was terrified and made a treaty with the British. This is called the “Treaty of Yandabu”. 24 February 1826. 1826. 1826. 1826. 1826. 1826 This is the treaty. The British took Arfan, Martaban, Tenachorim and Assam from the Mans by virtue of this treaty. This is what was written in this treaty about our country.” The Treaty of Yandabu, in 1742, brought Assam completely under the control of the British Singh (English Governor), forgetting the oppression of the Mans, and opening their homes for two days in the month of Chat Chandrakanta Singh Bargadeo left the throne, sailed the “Malar Din” (3 years 10 months 19 days) from which to 21st of Shark 1746 (the day David Hott, Sahib took “Ekat” in port with Shyam and Bagliphukan, intending to return to his country). &amp;quot;Article 2-His Majesty the king of Ava renounces all claims upon, and will abstain from all future interference with; the Principality of Assam, and its dependencies, and also with the contiguous petty states of Cachar and Jyantia-&amp;quot; 82</content>

In two parts, by order of the Government, Scott, in the “Southern Division”, is the “Governor General&amp;#39;s Ujnikhanda, or “Junior Agent and Commissioner Senior”. He took the office of Agent to the General and Junior Commissioner, and took up the administration of the country. Therefore, the southern section is called &amp;quot;Senior Motalk&amp;quot; and the southern section is called &amp;quot;Junior Jotalk&amp;quot; Scott, although he became the Governor-General&amp;#39;s Agent and Commissioner Senior in the Senior Motalk, not only became the ruler of the southern part, but also the real ruler of the country. Then, like the above kings, Fukan, Barua, Rajkhowa, Kakati, Katki, Khaund, Sabhapandit and Bhaga Barfukan, Barbarua, all were given scholarships according to their former subjects and merits. In order to stabilize the land, Bhaga Bargohai Dhananjay, Buragohai Paria Pijou, Bhaga-Dihingia Fukan, Kashinath Chetia Fukan of Chiring, and Rajali Chandradhar Roy were arrested with Barkakati and Pakhikakati; and “Agent Yovan” was made king and “Junior Yovan” was censused by the Indian miners. The Dihang-Dibang River is the western boundary on the north bank of this “Junior Motalk”; and the Budhi Dihing River on the south bank is the southern and western boundary; Thus the boundary of the “Junior Motalok” was set aside, and the upper section was separated by the “Aventi Yotalok”. Among these “Ejecti Motalk” were the villages of many hill tribes like Matak, Khamati, Singphou, Naga, Abar, Michimi, Sadia etc. “Junior</content>

<content>The Davis koi ode is still there; Thak Bhak is still known as “Narin Sahab Karr”. After the death of Newbil Chahar, Lieutenant Matthew Chahar temporarily replaced him as acting politician. Subsequently, on 17 Kavit, 1753 (1 November 1831), Major Ades White Chahar was replaced by Major Aves White, Lieutenant of Captain Newbill, Chahar&amp;#39;s political agent. According to the census taken earlier in the Junior Yovalk, Mr. Ades White of Jezreel arranged the deposit as follows: (Paikan Samua) – 22 of the 100 groups are divided upwards, the remaining 78 groups are the treasury of Paikan Samua like money; 187 in Sonwal group, Rs. 157 in Maria group, Rs. 3 in Miri-Dankla Bahtar group, Rs. 400 in Derania group; and from 1750 onwards, at Rs. 67 per group pike He put up a treasury. The “upper-division” of the Kari Pike is 100 groups of Fukan, Rajkhowa, or Barua, etc., 5 likchou, half of which is 24°, half of which is 74°; Hazarika likewise has 7.o groups in 100 groups, Shaikia 5 groups, forty groups and Powa Shaikia with forty bodies and Bora 6.° groups with 1.° Powara; There are 27 groups in total. There were formerly 4 in the group of Pyrrhus; But from the days of Rajeshwar Singh Bargade, there was a “group” cut in three years; This one is called “found”. During this time, the soil is covered in groups as the cover of the pike. Whoever increases this rate eats the land. The soil that does not grow is “harvested” and the soil that is eaten by the Thak Apaikan is also “cracked”. This cut clay pot is like 19 rupees Rajan applied; But in the case of Oz, the proverbial gods, Ekshottara, Mankar and Lakhebaj land what they got, on the pages of 50 Badhaliaghare treasury They applied it. and the government accounts which the Khatoran Pike received, from the gotv of Nei Paif since 1749, a total of 150 puras of paddy &amp;#39;of which 00 puras as the ara-bana base He gave the kingdom and planted 2,200 yogas of rice like the remaining 120 puras.

He died in August 1831 in Chirapunji. His “great” is still there. * Scott, Chahar died of illness because of overwork and lack of time to rest. He was a strong-willed, kind and generous Shahab And there was great mourning in all the people, both in the country and in the mountains, at the news of his death. What&amp;#39;s more, many wept over the death of your family. This sahib is still called “our Iskat sahib” in the southern part. His reputation is due to his liberation of the country from the hands of the Mans and bringing it to the path of good governance. ● The body of the grave bears the following inscription : In Memory of David Scott, Agent to the Governor General of the North-East Frontier of Bengal and Commissioner of Revenue Circuit in the District of Assam, North-Eastern part of Rangpur, and Sylhet. He died 20th August 1831, aged 45 years and 3 months. This monument is erected by order of the Supreme Government as a public and lasting record of its consideration for the personal character of the deceased, and of its estimation of the exclusive territory committed to his charge. By his demise the Government has been deprived of a most zealous, able &amp;amp; intelligent servant whose loss it deeply laments, while his name will long be held in grateful remembrance and veneration by the native population, to whom he justly was. endeared by his impartial dispensation of justice, his kind and con siliatory manners, and his constant and unwearied endeavors to promote their happiness and welfare. 80</content>

<content>Puranda Singh had already gone to Calcutta from Jorhat when he came to Man for the second time. In September 1819, Bargade gave a petition to the British Government, saying, &amp;quot;Drive out the Mans and give me the country, I will pay the expenses of the troops, and I will remain subject to the British Government. But then he was against yogurt so then the government did not look at his appeal. Then, as mentioned above, Scott, Sahib, persuaded the Government that it was better to appoint a native king in the Central Assam division. with that brightness A few days before his death, Scott and Sahar wrote to the Government that at least the southern Assam region (excluding Matak and Gadia, present-day Lakhimpur and Sibsagar districts) should be placed under a native king After his death, Robert, on behalf of the Commissioner of Chan Chaha, gave the same, and wrote to the Government thinking Purandara Singh suitable for the post.&amp;quot; His Majesty would pay the British Government Rs. 50,000 as a red prisoner ; and the Government would protect his kingdom from foreign invasion doubt of his fitness for the dignity, for which all united in preferring him to his only rival Chandrakanta. Purandar Singh is a young man, apparently about 25 years of age. His countenance is pleasing and his manners extremely good. His natural abilities seem respectable and his disposition mild and peaceful......... Major White and Lieutenants Mathie &amp;amp; Rutherford are all decidedly of opinion that Purandar Singh is the person best fitted to be at the head of the State which it has been decided to create.</content>

Therefore, it is necessary to take into consideration the fact that the present situation of the country is not the same. Therefore, the junior and senior rivers on the north bank, which were also drained by the Bharli river of Yovalk, have now been lifted and bounded by Kachujan above Bishwanath. Puranda Singh Bargade was also very greedy for money; He was a young man who fled abroad with his father and suffered greatly for lack of money. In 1838 it was found that Bargader was unable to pay the prescribed red prisoner. But his ways and the state of the land. Investigations revealed that Bargadeo was completely incapable and unfit to rule the kingdom His subordinates and Bargadeo himself did not care about the happiness and sorrow of Ekha, but only tried to earn money. In October 1838 (1760 AD), the British Government took back the kingdom, and two districts, Shivsagar and Lakhimpur, were established there. Captain Brody, Assistant or Principal Assistant to the Commissioner of the Southern Division (or Senior Yotalk), was appointed governor of these two districts. From this time onwards, the whole of Assam came under the control of the British, and with it the six hundred years of Ahom rule came to an end. The last kings of the Ahom were Chandrakant Singh, Purdar Singh and Yogeshwar Singh. They were accompanied by the end of the Ahom days of the Ahom Empire (and almost the Ahom dynasty) of Rs. 50,0 nitted to the charge of Rajah Poorandar Singh, the entire Civil and Criminal Administration was left in his hands, and his territory was secured from invasion on condition of his paying a tribute of Rs Capt.

He was very weak mentally due to physical irregularities, having received the kingdom at a very young age. He had no courage, and he did not know the qualities of the people. He was very shy in his eyes and had very little restraint. He was paid a pension of Rs. 500 and Rs. 500 per month from the Governor. He died in the same year and his son Ghankanta Singh Yuvraj received the pension. Keshavkant Yuvraj, son of Ghankanta Singh. Veve| He enjoyed that paternal pension. Now the lineage of Chandrakanta Singh Swargadeo has disappeared, only two daughters (daughters of Keshar Singh) are still alive. Mahindridevi, the widow of Yuvraj Keshar Singh, also died in Guwahati after enjoying a pension from a government house. Mahindri Rani Sandiky is the daughter of Gao Gogoi. Yogeshwar Singh Swargade died in 1747 at Yogighopa. His son Dambroth Singh, commonly known as the “Mad King”, was paid a pension of Rs. 50 and Rs. 50 per month from the government house.

<content>After the death of Mr. Robertson Scott, he was succeeded by Mr. T.S. C.S. Raratson came to this country on behalf of the Chahar Commissioner. He explained to the Government that it was very difficult to carry out all affairs properly without an assistant judge, and in consequence several assistants were appointed under him; thereby the country The way to good governance was opened. This is the one! During the reign of the Shah, Ujnikhand (present-day Shivsagar and Lakhimpur districts) was given to Purandar Singh Bargade as “Lalbandi”. The provinces of Sadia and Matak were not yet well established, so they were not given to Swargadeo. Major Ademu White remained as the political ante at Bishwanath, and was appointed to oversee the southern region. Although the southern part was given to His Majesty Puranda Singh, Mr. Robertson disordered his work to expand the southern part They couldn&amp;#39;t put it on. in Nagaon and Daranga Like Kamrup, there were panchayat judges and their revenue was collected by the tahchipdar. In 1832-33, Mr. Robertson divided the three districts of Kamrup, Daranga and Nagaon by order of the Government and appointed a Principal Assistant Commissioner with the powers of a Collector and a Magistrate Then he appointed European and national judges under them; And since there were no rules for the work of the country, this commissioner made rules for the caterpillars. Lord William Bentick was the Governor General of Calcutta at this time. He almost always approved of Mr. Robertson&amp;#39;s actions. Then, about the beginning of 1834, Mr. Robertson was transferred; He was succeeded by Captain (later General ) Jen Kintu Chahar in 1833 as commissioner. * Kamrup, Daraj and Nagaon Districts * The three districts of Kamrup, Damad and Nagaon mentioned above were originally headquartered at Khagarijan (this place called Khagarijan is a little away from the present Nagaon town. And formerly this district was called Nagaon Muhuli Astronomy District). In 1834, the headquarters was moved to Rajagara. There, too, the headquarters was moved to Purani Gudam, where it is still located. The capital of Kamrup has always been Guwahati. The headquarters of Sangajila first came to Mangaldai.

<content>In 1834, Captain Jekyll succeeded Captain Jane Kins Robertson as Commissioner of the Tea. Lord William Bent, however, recognizing Sahar&amp;#39;s wisdom and ability, appointed him commissioner of the new country. Earlier, in 1832-33, he had visited the region to investigate the produce of the country; But Vedia did not work in this country. There were several others in the country who had worked longer than him, but the Governor-General believed that Jekyll, the Shah&amp;#39;s gate The country will not be governed as well by anyone else. Jekil, on behalf of the Shahab Commissioner, divided the districts of the southern division into parganas and yauzas. There is a great way to improve the country by doing so. He began to inquire about the welfare of the people who enjoyed the barren land. In the days of the Mans, the Mans collected taxes from all kinds of people in the country. Therefore, this Commissioner forced the Nishkar lands to be half-taxed until the final order came from Sambar. In starting this, Jekyll, Chahar received the assistance of the Deshi Panchayat. { Under British rule, this country was initially entirely part of the Government of India. The Commissioner was the judge and chief judge. By Act 2 of 1835, the country was annexed to the Baddesh under the Sambarboard Radilit Thak Sadar Gadalat, and like the country, indigenous Mufis, Sadramins, etc., were appointed as judges. He was appointed a Commissioner in the Brahmaputra Valley and a Deputy Commissioner to assist him. They both often lived in Guwahati. Besides these, Principal Assistants and eight Surgeons were appointed daily and several Sadramins and Mufis were appointed in the civil departments.

In 1835, the monthly salary of the Sadramin and Muktis ranged from Rs. 300 to Rs During the reign of the Shah, an English beacon was established in Guwahati at the expense of the native and European gentlemen and with the assistance of the Government; and some indigenous language schools are established in parts of the country. Until 1836, the Assamese language was used in the courts of this country. But then someone says that the language of this country is widespread The same in language; In this way the government was persuaded, the spoken language became the norm in schools and courts, and the roots of the Assamese language were (at least for a time) struck with an axe. English is wrong in any Guwahati for the judicial system of this country; In the absence of any law or binding rules, a rule approved by Mr. Robertson Chahar, former Commissioner of the Assamese Language, was prescribed by the Sadar Court, and published in Iraq was called the “Assam Kardabandi”, and the trials were conducted according to the rules of this “Qaidabandi” until about The core of the ax Assam imprisoned Tularam Senapati was placed under the Swarabhya and Kachar Company in 1835 during the reign of this Commissioner and Jayant The king is paid a monthly pension of Rs. 500/-. At that time in Kachar, a Kachari king named Govindachandra ruled, the mountainous part of which was under the command of Tularam Senapati. He was the chief commander of the Kachari side in the war against the Kacharis during the reign of Bargder Kamaleshwar Singh. Govish Chandra was very tyrannical, and in 1833 he was captured by a Manipuri. He had no sons, and by the O Act of 1835, the kingdom of Gorichandra (Kachar) was incorporated into the kingdom of the Company. In 1838-09, Pur Singh Bargade failed to alert the “Lalbandi” and the southern Adash section came back under the Commissioner Chahar; and in Guwahati, Chandra Singh Bargadesh was paid a pension of Rs. 500 each. Pura Singh remained in Jorhat in fear of the king, but received no pension from the government. Then in 1842 the Matak province and the following year (i.e. 1840 ) Gahira fell to the British.

<content>Captain Jenkill, the Gohai Bar Senapati, captured the kingdom of Mataka and a Sadiakhwa Gohai of Khamati captured Nadia. In 1839, Captain Brody Chahar was appointed as his assistant as the Commissioner was responsible for both the judiciary and the administration of the country. Jenquil Chahar appointed Brody Chahar as the governor of the southern sector, and he paid great attention to the development of the country. He gave great encouragement to learning; He also taught many students of his own age. The hill tribes near our country have been harassing our people from time to time, and he (Commissioner Chahar) has repeatedly tried to put an end to that harassment He went on a war journey; But in the end our boundaries with those nations were determined by the census; and by that time the trouble of the mountain people seemed to cease. Trade with them was also very open until then. Captain Brovy (Rati Sahib) Arunodoi In 1838, a mission was established in the country by the American Broadcasting Missionaries to spread Christianity. First, the location or headquarters of the “mission” was determined at Jaipur; Then there is Shivsagar. In 1846, the American Baptist Mission published a monthly newspaper in Assamese called Arunodar. It has been a long time since the newspaper stopped circulating, but it was a special help to the education of the country. Captain Brody was called “Barti Chahar” by our people. He was also a noble-minded English prince. He was loved by the Assamese people when he was in Shivsagar district. What is more, the Assamese old people still talk about the “Amol of Rati Sahab” with great devotion. When he came to Shivsagar, Kachimath Kachilakh Buragohain, son of Purnananda Buragohain Bhasaria, died. At that time, the condition of most of the Bhadravanshis deteriorated. Ruchinakh Buragohain had two sons, Mahidhar Buragohain He was the father of the Bengali Gohai, Durgesh Barpatra Gohai, Dandeswar Barpatra Gohai, son of Valria, and several upper-class Bhavasaptans, such as Pisla Barpathra, who was born in the days of the Mans.

During the reign of this Commissioner, the Government opened several small tea plantations in several places in the south. Earlier, in 1823, a merchant named Robert Bruce came to the country; He also visited the first tea estates, Rangpur and Garhwal. When he sent word to the Singphous about Beharepar, he learned that there were tea trees in the country, collected some tea trees from them as samples, and the following year (in 1824) gave some of them to his brother Mr. C. A. Bruce. Scott sent the tea plants to the Superintendent of the Botanical Gardens in Calcutta for testing. Therefore, it is important to understand the importance of these factors in the development of Chinese tea plants The Chinese make tea, the tree is not the same as our tree. From 1824 to 1832, nothing else was heard about the tea tree. In 1832, when the Government sent Jekyll to investigate the produce of the country, Vedia C. A. Bruce, tea tells him that there are tea trees in this country. Jekyll, Chahar searches and writes to the government. The Government formed a committee of fourteen, with seven civilians, three English merchants from Calcutta, two native gentlemen, Dr. Oralis of the Botanical Gardens and Gordon Nayer with a secretary, to manufacture tea trees and tea from China. &amp;quot;&amp;quot; &amp;quot;&amp;quot; to bring Mahuh</content>

<content>Captain Jenkins, sent. Meanwhile, many investigations by Mr. Jenkins have proved that the tea tree of Assam, and the tea tree of China, are both of the same family and often identical; The leaves of this Assamese tea tree can also be used to make commercial tea. Later, Jekyll, the Chahab Commissioner, came and opened the government tea plantation and asked him to understand the evidence; He opened a small tea plantation near the confluence of the Kundil River with the Brahmaputra and appointed Cross as the Superintendent of the Shah. After a few days, the place seemed unsuitable for tea cultivation, and a new plantation was established in Jaipur. In fact, the plantation was in name only at the time, and tea was made from the leaves of wild tea trees in the jungle. In 1837, Mr. Bruce sent 46 boxes of tea from this plantation to Calcutta; However, due to packing errors, most of it was spoiled before reaching Calcutta; Those who got a little better were sent to Bilat. There are many ways to get rid of these diseases, but the most important thing is to get rid of these diseases It can compete with Chinese tea. 089 Assam Company opened a tea plantation in Jaipur from the Government In 1840, the Ragicha was sold to the Assam Company. The company was formed the previous year (in 1831) with a capital of about £600,000 to grow tea and they opened their “factories” along the Budhidihing and Tingiri rivers. Bruce, the two brothers of the Sahib (Robert Bruce, and C, A, Bruce, ), were the first to be credited with the discovery of the tea tree in Assam, followed by Jackins, Tea. The Agricultural Society of Calcutta honored Captain Jekyll with a gold medal for his work.In 1843, the Governor-General enacted an Act according to which no person could be treated as a slave to anyone more than usual or prisoners, most of whom were released.

<content>BIT Ahom days Never before had the Mahus of this country seen steamships; And from such ships many means of modern development of the country have been established. Mr. Pord Delhousie sent Mr. Muscat, Mills, Chahar, a scholar of the Sadar Court, to inform the local government of the first part of the ship, after seeing with his own eyes how the affairs of this country had gone since it came under the Company. He visited the districts of Assam in 1852 and made a report to the Government on the internal conditions of Assam, the happiness and sorrows of the people, etc. at that time. At that time, the condition of the people of this country was very poor. Although pensions, loyalty lands, etc. were given to the royal family and some other good gentlemen by the grace of Jekyll and Chahar, the majority of them were treasured in the lands of Lakheraj and Brahmottar, which they had enjoyed for generations When they were released under the Act of 1955, there was a shortage of people to do the work in the fields, and these noble families suffered greatly. Many of them began to tell Mitch and Sahar about their suffering, and some applied for pensions, some for tax-free land, or some for “jobs” under the government. At that time, the major government services were held by foreigners; So our people began to complain a lot about it to Jilch and Sahar. Mills, at the request of the sahib, who were from the Government at that time &amp;quot;The natives of the Province have great reason to complain of the preference which is too often given to Bengalese, when selecting officers to fill vacancies.

<content>In the days of the Ahoms, the Karad-kingdom was ruled as it was ; Sadly, his prayers were not accepted by Mills and Tea. The original of the petition of Maniram Dewan mentioned above was written in Assamese, which Miss, Sahib had translated into English and sent to the Government in a piece; As it happens, the same thing happened when someone laughed at the English translation of the Dewan&amp;#39;s application. No one can deny that what is written in it is true and very useful. One petition, that of Monee Ram Das, touches on these points. It is so curious a document, and being the production of a discontented subject, who once had in his hands the revenue administration of the country, that I have translated it into English and submitted it to His Lordship&amp;#39;s inofrmation the petitioner was formerly Collector Sherishtador, and is now without employ His real motive in decrying the coy&amp;#39;s administration and comparing that of the Assam rulers, is to get his country restored to the management of Rajah Poorandar Sing&amp;#39;s decendant the promotion, and endeavored to convince him of the futility of agitating it.

After the death of Dandekhar Barpatra Gohai, his two sons Bhareshwar and Mukheshwar Barpatra Gochas had earlier applied to Genkil Sahib for paternal pension and land through Brody Sahib. As they were both young at the time, the Government granted a pension of Rs. 50, Rs. 50 per month and 100 puras of land to Dandeswar Barpatra&amp;#39;s brother Yajneswar Barpatra Gohain to support them. This order was issued in March 1844 and we have attached copies of the correspondence in this regard.+ Monee Ram, son of Dandeswar Barpathra, has created much fermentation, disquletude, dreal amongst the lower classes.

This is the one It was during the reign of the Commissioner that the Criminal Penal Code and Procedure Code was first introduced in our country in This country is under British rule and no high-ranking government official has visited it since it came under British rule. In the spring of 1862, Mr. Biden visited the country as Lieutenant Governor. In his goodwill, there were many ways to improve the country; for he saw the condition of the land with his own eyes. There was a lot of forest and fallen land in this country to cultivate it and facilitate agriculture in the country, when a rule was introduced that the government would sell certain fallen lands at auction and lease them for long periods Many tea plantations were established in many places. The people of this country are very few, many were broken up during the reign of the Mans and many people were captured by the Mans. Those that are cannot abandon your agriculture either. Therefore, the tea plantation companies started bringing in laborers or &amp;quot;coolies&amp;quot; from abroad; and a “slave law” was introduced to bring, keep, and employ the slave.

<content>Sir George Campbell was a man of the Ahom days; He saw that this was a great injustice to the Assamese people. Mr. Trunson, American Baptist, Mission, collected an English dictionary from an Assamese at that time. He wrote in its introduction. Sir George Campbell also understood what Mr. Bronson wrote in the introduction, and he ordered that the Assamese language be used in the courts and schools of this country. Until then, the Assamese language should be used in every court and school in this country. Bruce began to improve the situation in this country in all respects. The government could not pay much attention to this country as it was with Baddesh; and, especially considering that it would be in the best interests of the country in every way if the Governor-in-Chief remained in the country, the country was placed under a Chief Commissioner at the end of February, 1874, when Colonel Hope, Kins, retired and the Governor-General of India has taken over its authority in your hands. • Unfortunately an impression has prevailed that Assamese and Bengali are identical or nearly so. Hence all the schools, courts and official business of every kind are conducted in Bengali. This has greatly retarded the cause of education and general progress among the masses. They have no inclination to abandon their own for a foreign dialect. The higher classes seeing their own language ignored strive to obtain a sufficient knowledge of Bengali to fill Government offices, but they never feel at home in that language. In the family and social circle, nothing but the vernacular is spoken. Were the Government now to abandon the country, Assamese would supersede all other dialects, simply because it is the language of the masses.</content>

<content>Early Ahom Race and Religion The Ahom kingdom mentioned in Part I was formerly a &amp;quot;Tai&amp;quot; people of the Shan province within Ramma or Mandesh. They were not called Ahom before they came to this country. How Cyril got the name Ahom after his arrival here has already been told at the beginning of the first part. The Ahom were formerly Buddhist people. They believed in God as Phura Tara Anang” meaning &amp;quot;Astrologer Purnabrahma&amp;quot;. Their main anniversaries are 1. Phuralung (or “Franung&amp;quot; ) 2. Mesi-mal, 3. Alika, 4 Jukham | Mulu, the main scripture Nejao and 7. Pang-rao. This The Sabhosana Dharma says that non-violence is the supreme religion, and that is the motto of their religion. The Ahom were a mixture of the Mahayan and Hin-Ran communities &amp;quot;The race (the Shans began to spread into Burma from South-Western China about two thousand years ago. Its migration was hastened by the pressure of the Chinese races behind, and as the pressure increased, it spread from the valley of the Shweli river, its first home in Burma, Southwards to the Siamese sens, Eastward to Tongking and North and West till it reached the Brahmapootra and founded the Ahom kingdom of Assam.&amp;quot; &amp;quot;The Ahoms or Ahams of Assam are a branch of the Taie-Shan race; The Ahom kings surrendered their Shan names.</content>

<content>The days of the Ahom are gone. In Shan, the “Lithu” are called “Subba”. The Lithus are now Hindus ; The Ahoms are also (at least mostly) now Hindus. The Shyams and the Shans of Burma are Hindu Buddhists. The Ahoshtes and the Shamites have the same roots. According to the Tai or Ahom, the creation process and the great flood According to the Tai or Ahom scriptures, the whole earth was watery in the beginning of creation. Then “Fa” means Almighty God hanging in the sky in the form of “Honeycomb”. Then at one time he himself assumed a form and created a crab from his body called Khun Thio-Kham. The crab was floating in the water with its face upwards. Then “Fa” created a frog, a five-faced snake, and a toothed elephant, and made a mountain to the north, dug a pole on its top, and tied ropes to it. Then he created two golden spiders. The earth was formed on the waters by their excrement; And they went up to the top of the mountain, and spun threads, and made nets of them, and made the heavens. Then “Fa” created a female. The woman laid four eggs, and in time the four eggs bore four children. The first seven were commanded to be kings on earth, the second in the underworld, and the third in hell, and the calf was placed with him to help him in creation Yes, it&amp;#39;s. and so on. 2. 2. Most of the flood victims. One is in the religious book of the nation. There is a great flood. There is also such a catastrophe in the Tai or Ahom scriptures. Who? Who? At one point. The people of the earth became worse sinners. Auspices, chanting, yoga, meditation, worship, burnt offerings, etc. in the world. The gods were in great trouble for not being worshiped by the people, and the gods were angry with the king of the gods (Indra) to punish them</content>

<content>They are the ancestral races and religions of the Ahoms. Langun first summoned Newfafa (the bird of the goat) and ordered him to come down to earth and swallow Manuskhosh. The great pride came down from the square of Newfafa, and began to swallow up the people of the earth whom he found. There were so many people on earth that even Newfafai Obe could not swallow a million people all day. Finally, he fell on his own. Seeing this condition of Newfafa, the Mahuhs, leaning on their saddles, approached with sixty, jongs, and tokon-talons, and began to dain as much as they could. When the people saw that Newfafa was dead, they left him and went away. Shortly after the men left, Newfafa flew away to the square; and told Landon all the story. After much thought, Langdon sent a terrible lion to earth to devour and kill the people. The lion came to earth and ate people. The lion could not move his stomach, so the brave young man Emkhai came with Sadon and laid an egg on his back. The lion trembles. They took it, grabbed it, and ran to the square. Two attempts failed, and this time Langron sent down a large number of snakes to earth. The snakes also came down to the ground. People think they are snakes, where do I go in fear, what do they do They put it on. Then, by the wisdom of a brave young man, he tied up a bundle of straw and set it on fire. The lizard was ashamed and told Chaoran (the sun god) to open the sun of the flood and dry up the waters of the earth. Chaobam took Chaofaluk (Arun) with him and sunbathed with his full veg. The waters of the earth are dried up The people could not get out of the house, and they began to struggle. Thus a year passed. The month of Dim Ching (Aghon) of the New Year has come, yet the people have not worshiped the gods. Slowly, the 21 days of Taochila, the month of Sharkar Dinsi (Phalgun), passed, but the burden of the people&amp;#39;s minds did not move. Langdon weighed, all his efforts failing. Sin has completely overwhelmed mankind. This is sinful They cannot be brought to the path of association by any means. Here he wrote “Cheng-kai-phakhen~raman” (Kurer), “Khed-sung-khai Chen-kyu” (wind), “Lau-e” (Vishvakarma), “Tailang” (May), “Swak-pang” (Chitragupta), “Chaopham” (Bakshan), “Jachitka” (Saraswati). with the gods</content>

After some secret advice from Langdon and Ai-Khankhak Hoyojan, then Ai-Khankhak Land, Nar Anushati respectively went to “Thao-lip-linga” or Narada Dhwabi. He swore to kill him in Rahat, and said to Khao-lip, Linga, &amp;quot;Brother, Khao-lip, . The people of the earth have become great sinners.

Slowly, 24th of Falgun arrived. Thao-lip, Ling gathered all the Mithi family and ate a meal in public. That evening I-khang-khake They came and stayed at his house. Thaolip, Lis, and his children did not tell anyone that the flood would come the next day. That night, about a stick before the night, he brought his heifer and put it on the rock. With Ai-Khang-Khak and him for about a month, Chuo came and stayed at a distance. While Puren was giving, the god Landon ordered the god “Chaophafun” or Varuna to rain hot water and cause a great flood on the earth. Chaophafun also told Meghror to pour hot water and cover the earth. In this hot water, the king lost all his life in the I-Bang-Rak, Thao-Lip, Linga and Futuki Gajani, which were climbing on the rock. Landon&amp;#39;s orders did not fall on this vineyard.

After six days, the boat rolled the carrots, and after three days, it became flat After four or five days, numerous trees covered the mountain tease. Landon sent an angel named Ghukheoren to fertilize the root of the tree. After a few days (although the laurel tree had sprouted a lot ) it produced only one laurel at all. He covered a world with that stick. There are many ways to get a job in the field of architecture. There are many ways to get a job in the field of architecture A month later, Langron called his eldest son, Iphalan, and ordered him to cut the stick with a rope, and said that a new one would be created from it. Ifalan came to tear the stick with a rag. But as he straightened the rope, he called out to the other side of the boat, &amp;quot;O God!

The next year, seeing that all living things, including humans, were scarce, the king of the gods sent Aiphalan and sowed four handfuls of seeds of the four races of Uran, Buran, Gajan and Prashan. These four handfuls of seed produced flying plants, aquatic plants, and all kinds of animals that live on the ground. The language of the Tai Ra Ahosh was distinct and rich. Dewai, Mohan, Baidud, especially the Jamus of these three games, practiced writing and reading in the Ahom or Tai language. In this language, the history of Baje was almost entirely written in the hall of reading, while the bookmakers were open. There was also a separate astrology in this language. There are many examples of these characters in the books of the Ahom scholars. These characters are the characters of the Ahom scholars. Even people who do not have a good taste of modern astrology will not believe it. In the past, the Ahom scholars could predict the results of the year by the master of that astrology. “bab-set” stay “bukura-the;&amp;quot; These are the two</content>

<content>The Ahom ancestry and religion Ahosh is the chief source of astrology. In the past, Ahom scholars looked at “Mars”. “Ran-cheng” is used to see good fortune in general, in warfare with “chicken-these” but by hooking on the royal side of other branches, “deo kari” with its stem. “Ban-cheng” is read in a slightly shorter tone than rice. Religious books such as “Furalung” (or Falung) also have different tones. That is, the Lord above is the Lord of all, and He teaches us to serve Him. There are many books in the Ahom language besides these. The Ahoms were very skilled in writing history, and were the foremost in the world There are 1 consonants and 23 consonants in the Tai or Ahom language Therefore, the Ahom language cannot be easily translated in the present day, but it cannot be expected to exist for long. The Ahom language is a completely different language, and has a different alphabet, yet it is on the verge of extinction Dictionary ) to the Alam Government, and the dictionary was printed by the Government at great expense in The letters of the language were almost extinct, and the kind government spent a lot of money not to print this dictionary</content>

<content>If it were the days of the Ahoms, they would have disappeared. Therefore, the whole of Khamarbani, especially the Ahoshas, should be burdened with jewellery. There are many ways in which you can improve your self-confidence. There are many ways in which you can improve your self-confidence. It is surprising, however, that after ruling for so long, the Ahoys, unable to learn the customs of the Bhaya Talatira of the Vengs, adopted the lower languages of Abi and Bhalbhiya Esar; But there are some burdensome reasons. The ancient histories show that:—–(1) the number of Tai or Ahom Mahus was very small when they arrived in this country; (2) the Tai or Ahom who came to see Assam were forced to marry girls of the Bhaltia caste because they had no females or the number of females was very low; And I had to speak to the girl in Assamese; (3) There were no Chai kings in other states of India, and the Chai language was not widely spoken, so the Ahom kings found it difficult to write letters in their Tai language to other neighboring kings; (4) We also offer our gratitude to the prostitutes of the Ahom kings, Bhajarias, Baruas, Ligiras, Ga-Chawas, Ghar-giris of the Fus, etc. Seeing this kivap, you are in devotion to what Colonel Garbhar Sahab, the thirsty Karichana of Anam, has said Hon. &amp;quot;The Ahoms are proud of their former language notwithstanding, for it was the language of the race which conquered Assam, in the thirteenth century, and in which the Buranji&amp;#39;s or histories The number of Ahoms in Assam, according to the Census Tables of 1911, was 1,97,444, being confined to the Brahmaputra valley, where 66 per cent of their number was enumerated in the Sibsagar and 30 per cent in the Ahom Districts, which is the oldest of the Northern Shan Alphabets shows unmistakable connection with the Lao, although in an abbreviated form (cf. Milne and Cochrare&amp;#39;s Shans at Home. p. 212) and Ahom belongs to the same group of Tai languages as Khamti and Shan Shans who, under the leadership of Chukapha, crossed the Patkai range from Burmah and entered the upper portion of the Brahmaputra valley about AD 1228.

<content>The Ahom&amp;#39;s ancestry and religion were lost; They spoke the Ahom or Tai languages, and the Bajabharias had to learn Assamese to communicate with them. There are several reasons why the use of the Ahom language in Brure declined; Finally, the Ahoms became poets of their own language in their own language. As mentioned above, the Ahom are very skilled in writing history and are the foremost in the world. As soon as they set foot in the other, the discussion of Irav history began. There is no formal history of Assam before the arrival of the Ahoshas. Many of them are dependent on Kimbanti and Puranadhi. The histories written by our Ahoshas from the beginning of the 10th century can be called histories in the true sense. Initially, the histories were written in the Ahom language; Later, the practice of writing histories in Assamese also began. During the reign of the Ahom dynasty, history developed to such an extent that there was a certain poisoner in the market to supervise the writing of history and to write it. The first chapter was in the hands of the Bargohai Valbiwa; But from the days of Rajeshwar Singh Bargadevvar, Rajamantri Kirti (Now Sir Edward Gait) was his secretary, gave every encouragement to the work of linguistic and ethnological research in the province. It was under their guidance, and it was due to their initiative, that the work of research in the rich linguistic field of this portion of the North Eastern Frontier of India took tangible shape. The present dictionary is one of the results of this wise policy. Sir Edward Gait encouraged Rai Sahib Golap Chandra Baruah, then a humble clerk in the Assam Secretariat, to learn the Ahom language, and it is by dint of the latter&amp;#39;s perseverance and linguistic ability that not only this dictionary but also translations of the Buranjis or histories of the Ahoms were completed. In 1899 Rai Sahib Golap Chandra Boruah published specimens of the Ahom written script to Sir George Grierson, then at work on the volume of the Linguistic Survey of India, which deals with the Monkhmier and Siamese-Chinese families (including Khasi and Tai). and Rai Sahib Padmanath Gohain Baruah of North La pur were the most minent, took keen interest in this research work, and it was largely due to their interest and to that of other scholars in the province that the Govt. of Sir Archdate Earle, the then Chief Commissioner of Assam, undertook the publication of the present work . . . . . In conclusion it may be stated that the present work is a most valuable contribution to our knowledge of the languages of the North Eastern Frontier of India and that the Government of Assam, as well as the author, Rai Sahib Golap Chandra Boruah, are cordially congratulated on the appearance of this most valuable dictionary.&amp;quot; Sd/- P.

<content>The Ahom Barkara brought the post into the hands of Barkara. From Vevia, the young Thulikhowa and Baba Baghati remained with Barrakara until the end of the Ahom dynasty. The writing was in the house of Tibio. At that time, every meeting left the history of the country. As soon as we taught Ranbita, the princes were taught a sense of historical events like fairy tales. There is no doubt that only the history of Assam was studied during the reign of the Ahom kings; The history of countries like Bengal, Kashmir etc. (what is more, in the ancient history of the whole of India) was also written in Assamese. Some of the Ahon names had special meanings in the names of the Ahom kings and the titles of their officers. The word &amp;quot;Chao&amp;quot; was used before the names of kings and satisfied officials, such as:—“Chao Chukapha”, “Chao Frachengmul”, “Chaokamchel,” and so on. In Ahom or Tai, “Chao” means god, but its semantics declined to “owner” and “king”. Occasionally, the word “Thaoshung” was also used before the names of noble officers and “Bhao” before the names of kings, such as “Thaoshung Laikhepena” (Bargohai Valria), “Tyachukhangpha”, “Bhaokhamridhi” (Bakha), etc. “Khao” means old man, “mbu” means country, so “Thao Mu” means “old Buddha of the country”; “Tyao” means possessor in Tai. The names of the Ahom kings were preceded by “Chu” and ended by “Fa” or “Mu”. “Chu” means field, “fa” means square, and “hung” means country. Between these two words another respectful term was used, such as Chu-chen fa (Chu—ragha and Chen—beautiful; Fa—class) meaning the beautiful tiger of the class and Chu-chen-mung (Chu-bab and Chen-beautiful; Moong—country) meaning the beautiful tiger of the country or kingdom. Since the conversion of the Ahom kings to Hinduism, the Middle Ahom word has the same meaning as the Hindu name,&amp;#39; eg :~-Chu-pattapha (leaf, means mace) Gadadhar Singh; Chulungpha (Eng means a) Jasingh and so on. The Ahoshas pronounce “s” as “h” in all places. Therefore, many argue that the Ahom word “Gohai” is merely a derivation of the Sanskrit word “Gorami” from the arrowhead “Gosai”. In fact, Jane is not. The word “gohai” is a translation of the word hei, “kang”—a big wheel or drum;</content>

<content>The Ahom ancestral and religious words are translations, meaning market boys. They were called “Gogoi” when they had children in the wombs of the king, except for the chief princesses of the king. Nowadays, however, the word &amp;#39;Gogoi&amp;#39; seems to be used in other senses. The word “Nandikai” is written as “Sandhikai” in ancient histories, but it is actually a translation of the word “Hudikai” (Hanri-dikai, hum means fort, Difai means to fall or cross, i.e. to cross a fort or bridge). “Fukelud,” (meaning &amp;#39;Yurih—great man—Bhadar&amp;#39; ) is called “Chaofrang,” (meaning the god of the crossed country), Bargohai “Chaoranglud,” (meaning the best god of the old man) and Barpatra Gohai “Chao-Chenglud,” (meaning the god of the country). The word “Fukan” means “great man” in the Ahom language. “Chaopha” means “great man” in the Ahom language There was no rule of burning; they buried the dead in earlier times. When a king or princess died, they made a wooden plank (like the coffins of the British) long enough to hold the arrow. There are six boards on each side, two on each end, and the boards are to be made of Urikha wood. That is why Ahosh uses Uriam wood There are many ways to get a job, but the most important thing is to get a job. There are many ways to get a job, but the most important thing is to get a job.

Later, from the days of the Chuhung or Dihingia kings, the kings who rose to the throne, the princesses, “kang,dal,” crabs They are carried on a swing, accompanied by singers, and the king goes around with the bardhak. They are the ones who catch the white arrows first, and the bird-catchers cover them with the beds of the birds. The place where the devotee builds a house of shal wood is called “kareng-kang,bhash”. Coming here, the banana,shoots from the branch. According to the Ahom tradition, Raidud, a scholar, recites the mantra “Bikrit, Ban” and bathes the deceased with the arrow in the hands of the lukhura. Then, dressed in new clothes (royal ornaments if he is a king), the arrow is placed on a bed erected inside the “kareng-kal,dal,” with the head facing east and feet facing west. Any position of the colors of gold maihag, bhogjara, pitradan, etc. used while alive is placed inside the “kareng-kang,-dal.” There is a seven-story golden roof over the room, a golden mirrored roof on the floor, and a gold-plated roof all around Four pillars, rice golden running bark stars.

There are many examples of these characters in the books of the Ahom kings. In the days of Maharaja Jaidhwaj Singh Bargade, the Emperor of Delhi, Aurangzeb, Pat, Sir Senapati Mir, Bhum and Lai invaded Assam. and he dug many graves, and carried thence gold and precious stones into the land. ● Miller&amp;#39;s armies were accompanied by a soldier named Glanjus.

<content>Both Glenius of the Ahom days, and Tavernia, wrote many things based on oral legends of the time, and it seems that they are exaggerated in many places You can&amp;#39;t even copy it. It is certain that no one dug the tombs of the Ahom kings and Da-Bhadris before Mir Jumla&amp;#39;s invasion and took out the money. In Neither times, people believed that ghosts, vampires, witches, and sorcerers lived as if they were alive, especially in the tombs. No one dared to dig a grave for fear of such things. They lived in the tombs with the kings, as Glenius, and Trevernier say, by captives, daughters, wives, etc Many say that there was a custom, but there is no way today to get any other accurate account of this except in legend. It is only known from ancient history that on the death of King Chukapha, both Maut Pham-kin and Kalj-Bara of Barahi, who had come with him, were “kai-chip” (?) and buried in the tent. Then, in the days of Bhagaja (Churampha), the daughter of Bhandari Gohai, Barkunwari, adopted a son of the lineage; Therefore, the princess cried and told the king, “How can Morild, the boy, live alone inside “Kareng Rung, Dal,” and who will warm him when he goes? But that didn&amp;#39;t turn into action. In the days of Ramdhvajalingha (Churunpha) Swargadeo, Debera Barbarua killed the king by feeding him Bihu, killed Laitayug, the grandson of Ghorakowar, and Gargara Sandiky&amp;#39;s Kalia, and “squeezed” the king&amp;#39;s tail It is said that the king was “kicked and squeezed on the tail”. There is nothing else in history about this. There is a legend that four heads of men came out of the tomb of Rudra Singh Bargade and ten or eighty heads of men in the tomb of Pramatta Singh Bargade; But this story| How far it is true, it is impossible to say. As for the Bhangaris who eat the subject, everything is almost like that of the kings, where the arrows of the Bhangarias are carried by the mahuhe (often carried by the householders); There are many ways to get a job, but the most important thing is to get a job.

When the bodies of Barrakara and Barphukan are taken away, the singers go with them, but they are not allowed to play yesterday. There are two rows of books on both sides of the body of the Barphukan, and the tajon is carried in front and behind. Like the Melkhowa kings, and most of the nobles of the Melkhowa Gohais, only their dead arrows, like those of the kings, can be carried by Lukhuragn. The king&amp;#39;s own seven households The other princes of the Ahom Maidam dynasty, like the Barua Fukans, who received straw according to their status and social status; Their bodies should not be taken by the Ludhura. The Bangahars of the Dadangrias and the other seven-house Ahom people are sometimes called Rakra Fukans, depending on their status and rank; However, they sometimes bury their dead like the ordinary Pike Ahoms. There is no “kareng phal” or “dad” among the ordinary pike and samura classes of Ahom, nor is it the custom to “kal, dal” to insert the arrow.

Ahom where there was a shraddha ritual and that shraddha was performed by Railud Pandit. Later, the kings, Chiringfukan, and other Bha-chadarias, Barfukans and Barkaras, the six Fukans of Chora, and the Prahmadi Kriyakagu of the Rebisni Pora Barua Fukans were performed by the people of the series. The Mandu of Chiring&amp;#39;s house is the same as Bainud in the beginning. Later, when the Ahom kings converted to Hinduism, the burden fell from Vedia on Rajof Fukan, and their Praddhas became like Hindus. This does not mean that Rajof Fukan performed or should have performed shraddhas for all classes of Ahoms. The Prahmadi Karora of the royal house was the main task of Rajguru Fukan; There are also a few other houses, such as Bha-Bhalria, Barbarura Barphukan, etc., which are held in the shraddhas of the chief Ahom families of the upper classes, while the others are not performed by the Rajguru-Phukan. Other Ahoms were performed by Shrahmas and other Brahmins. The burial customs we have been talking about above; Most of the tombs of the Ahom kings were in Charideo. In 1766 Shatru (1844 AD) the first (after Mijumla) tomb of Laxmi Singh Bargadeo in Charideo was dug out by the son of Kuria Bora; Then he was arrested and handed over to Dak Fatek. It is believed that the tomb was built in It is said that many things were found there. From the foundation, people believed that there were no ghosts in the tomb; and forty or fifty men gathered together in other places They started digging (very secretly, of course). In 1768 (1846 AD) the Feitayan tombs were not excavated. They were excavated to carry the bones to the tomb of the Dihitia king to be built by Purarsingh Bargader; The load description valve is given—this baifam was probably cooked in 1547 (1462).

The tomb is said to have been excavated in 1562 (1474 AD), ten years after its construction. Legend has it that necklaces appeared in places inside the tomb. It is believed that the tomb was built in 1611 (1533 AD). In Khanal, a large amount of gold and silver artifacts were also unearthed inside this tomb. 800 This tomb is the largest of all the tombs of the Ahom kings. Therefore, they dug secretly, and no one could enter it. Later, Purandarasingh Swargade hired about a hundred men and dug the tomb for two months. There was a lot of stuff out there too, he said. This Maidas was built in 1696 by Rudrasingh Bargade of Gadadhar Singh Swargade (1618). The skull of Gadadhar Singh Swargade was found in the tomb. Purandara Singh brought it and hung it at the entrance of his gate for many days for all to see; Then he said, Laokholate from the government They took him to the Calcutta Museum. When the grandmother ( grandmother ) of the collector of this book came and went to the house of King Purandara Singh, the Laokholate I remember telling the collector that I saw it with my own eyes. He said that the shell would be the size of a large rice-carrying stick. There is no reason to disbelieve that ; The collector of this book saw with his own eyes an index fingernail worn by Swargade Gadadhar Singh; That stick is a year and a half old Children can also wear it on their hands like they wear a khak. The tomb was about thirty cubits deep when it was dug. Rudra Singh Bargade died in Guwahati. and woodworking Rudrasingh Swargade is buried on the Manikarneshwar Mountain; But the Ahom kings must have had Maidas Charideo.

He found it with a golden earring, a diamond necklace, three rows of pomegranates, and a line of diamonds. The tomb is slightly smaller than the tombs of Gadadhar Singh and Rudra Singh Swargade. The tomb was built in 1751 (1673 AD) ; The tomb was a fairy. It is impossible to tell what they found when they dug it. The tomb of Pramatta Singh Swargadeo Rajeshwar Singh Swargadeo fell ill outside Debargaon and died; But a tomb was also built for him in Charideo. The tomb was built in 1761 (Shank 1691). Legend has it that the tombs of these two kings contained the largest amount of wealth. The tomb of Laxmi Singh Swargade was built in 1789 (Shanka 1711) by Gaurinath Singh Swargade. This tomb is smaller than the tombs of other kings. It was probably built in 1795 by Gaurinath Singh Swargade (1717 Shukat ). It is said that he dug a tomb and found a lot of things. In 1811 (1733 AD), during the reign of Chandrakanta Singh Bargade, the tomb of Kamaleshwar Singh Swargade was built by the Rajamantri Purnananda Buragohain. There is no exact account of what was found when he was buried. Sussex, the tomb of Fa Ra Buddhi Barganarayana Maharaja (who was cooked in 1649) was in the tea garden. It was also re-excavated by Puranda Singh Bargder (this tomb had been excavated once in July), but it is not known exactly what was found there.

This place in Jorhat is now known as “Rajamaidas”, and near it, facing the tomb, our dear friend, the Council of State, the Honorable Mr. Chandradhar Barua, has taken up residence. The tombs of Purandarsingh and Kameshwarsingh with the betel-nut and which I have been told to be afterwards purchased by Mr. . Bedford. The tooth-pick case was silver and the gold ornaments were different from the usual ornamental stones at the ends. This tomb was, I am afraid, of too recent a date to answer the purpose of comparison for which you required the description. Robinson&amp;#39;s Assam makes no mention of the particular time or circumstances of this Bura Gohain&amp;#39;s death, but I have met with two or three elderly men who stated they could remember it, and I am inclined to think that it must have taken place to recently as 1810-1 The tradition regarding this is as follows. Immediately after the Bura Gohain received private information that the Rajah had joined in a plot against his life, he therefore used every means to get the latter into his power, who, however, fled from Assam to Calcutta and afterwards to the Burman court addressed a letter on the Rajah stating among other matters that he had already prepared instruments of torture for the purpose of putting to death his old enemy the Bura Gohain. The letters by some accident were exchanged, that to the Rajah falling into the hands of the Bura Gohain, who despairing of escape, suffocated himself by swallowing a large diamond. I trust you will excuse my troubling you with this disgression, but I have thought that however exaggerated, there was perhaps some little truth in the leading points of the story; and if so, the position of the Bura Gohain at the time, together with the troubled state of the country, will account for the apparently rough way in which so great an affair was entered, and the trifling articles of value that were found with him. I have seen the interior of another old tomb after it had been plundered in which was also a coffin and the general plan of the place was precisely similar to the one I have described. A third that I had an opportunity of seeing deffered so far as regards the substitution of a bedstead highly ornamented with carved wood work for the coffin, and from the grave a small portion of the bones of the head small boxes, some of which appeared to contain articles of clothing one appeared to hold a quantity of reddish colored matter that have been &amp;quot;Sindoor&amp;quot; another had been filled with miniature tools and weapons such as spear and arrow-heads, hatchet, hammer chisels the usual eating and cooking vessels turban or head-dress.

<content>It was the day of the Ahom. In the middle of the tomb, a bamboo 24 cubits long was buried and the tomb was cooked as high as the tomb of Bhar Kaliabhomora Barphukan; But the people of the cave were surprised when they dug the ground, and at night the barnman cut off four arms of it and cooked the grave with earth up to the front of the bamboo branch forty feet high during the night. There are only signs of this tomb now; I don&amp;#39;t hear about digging it. There are still many tombs in many places. Order of becoming king On the death of his father, his Barjana Kovar often succeeded him. 1 If Barjana Kovar is unfit to become king for incompetence or for any other reason, his successor It was the rule to give the kingdom to the Kauvars. This was the rule in the early days of the Ahom Empire. However, there were exceptions to this rule in the latter period. Sometimes the brother of the late Raksha became king instead of his son. For example, the five princes of Rudrasingh Swargadeo. Four of them became kings one after another according to the deathbed of their father; and sometimes the nephew of the late mother or the prince of a closer relationship than the rice took the throne; But there are not many examples. Thus, a distant prince became king only if a close relative was unfit for any reason. King Whate the expressed or otherwise indicated desire of the previous king; the throne-seeking princes&amp;#39; own royal qualities and powers; and depends on the selection of the chief officers of the kingdom, such as the three noblemen Barbarua and Barphukan. When the Dandangaris had to grow princes, they often did not make a distant prince king instead of a nearby prince. When such a close relative is unworthy of being saved by sight, and the rule and behavior of the previous king clearly shows that if the latter king is his close relative, the kingdom and the kingdom are in danger of misfortune They make him a king. When a branchman thinks that he is more powerful than anyone else, he protects a prince so that he will receive special favor from him or even more than before</content>

It is still said in our country, and there is a superstition that there can be no king unless three nobles agree and come together; And the king can fry only if the three of them agree.

After 1670 AD The majority of the princes who succeeded to the throne until the end of the Ahom Empire thus became kings at the mercy of a Bhangaria or Barbarua, or Barphukan. Although Chuhul and Gobar Kowar were distantly related, thus by the grace of Debera Barbarua, Sujinpha and Chudaifa became kings by the grace of Bahugaria Atan Buragohain and Sulifa (or Lararana) and Gadadhar Singh by a Barphukan each There are many different types of characters in the film, but the most important one is the character of the heroine There are many ways to get a job in the UK, but the most important thing is to get a job in the UK They were held.

If the princes had injuries on their limbs, and there were signs of spring, the prince was unfit for the throne or was considered so. Therefore, the young king mutilated many princes who wanted the throne. These mutilated princes are called &amp;#39;ear-cutting princes&amp;#39; * King&amp;#39;s coronation According to the Tai or Ahom, the ascension of kings to the throne and the “ascension to the throne of Shivari” are separate acts.

Aju called his grandmother (great-grandmother ) &amp;quot;Ralin&amp;quot; &amp;quot;Ja-khao&amp;quot; and &amp;quot;Baichao&amp;quot; It is still called “Baichao” nowadays. The uncle (father&amp;#39;s or thak&amp;#39;s father)—“pu-thao” is called “puthadeo” or “putha deuva”; he is still called that way today. The grandmother (mother&amp;#39;s mother) was called “ra-nai”. These days it is called “Aideuta.” The relationship “Aideuta” is also used among the Ahom other castes. “Bupadeuta” was such a relationship; although they usually call their father “Duta” nowadays, such relationships as “Aputi” and “Bupadeuta” are still common. They were called “lung, chao”, “ni-chao” and “ni-cha” if they were related to their father&amp;#39;s or mother&amp;#39;s brother or uncle. Nowadays, they are called “Nichao” “Nichadeo” or “Nichadeuta”. They were called “Ao”, “Ao-chao” and “Be-thai” if they were related to their father&amp;#39;s brother or brother. Even today, some families call their grandfather “Bethai Deuta”; But they are usually called “Dadaideo” or “Khuradeo” nowadays. A mother&amp;#39;s brother or brother&amp;#39;s relative is also called a momai or momaide. This is where it comes from It is noteworthy that among the Ahom other tribes, the mother&amp;#39;s brother is the momai, the brother is the momai; But this cannot be the case among the Ahoms ; If he is older than his mother, he shall be called “Nichadeo”, and if he is his mother&amp;#39;s brother, he shall be called “Momaideo”. father&amp;#39;s or mother&amp;#39;s grandfather and grandfather is related People are called “pu-nai” “pu-khao” “pu-kha-deo”. They are still called Puthao or Puradeuta Kar. ● If he was a relative of his father&amp;#39;s or mother&amp;#39;s sister or brother, he was called “pa-chao” or “apa”. These days, Apa or Apade also opens. They are also called aunt or aunt if they are the sister or sister-in-law of the father-in-law. Formerly called “Poo-ai” and “Ye-a”. The aunt&amp;#39;s husband was called “ri-dhui”, mostly called &amp;quot;po” or “pesadeo”. His mother&amp;#39;s sister was called &amp;quot;-r”,</content>

<content>The Ahom ancestry and religion were not created; The Bartop which Bahikhawa Barphukan gave to Rajeshwar Singh Bargade was built only during the reign of Rudra Singh Bargade. That whatever &amp;#39;however the number of such firearms that was not nearly insignificant, is incense | In the reign of Jaidhwaj Singh Swargadeo, Ballabh Mir, the chief of the Aurangzeb emperor, invaded Assam from Ghushala and took away 675 chilas from this country. The bullet of the largest of them weighed three pounds. He also carried 343 huthurs, 1,200 ramchalis, 6,570 hand-barrelled guns and 7,828 shields. These hills were not the number of low guns that Mirjumla had not measured or used in name from Assam. The Ahom kings have been in Assam since the Dihingia king conquered the Chutia kingdom and conquered the sweet Holong Barbhop They were not used much in the absence of external warfare. After the conflict with the Muslims, the Ahom kings developed and used many new techniques They are the ones who have been able to re-establish the extinct science of the Ahoms. They are the ones who have been able to re-establish the extinct science of the Ahoms These people (the Ahoms) invented Hila salt and Hila Then gradually that knowledge| It flows from Assam to Pend and China. This is why it is said that Jai Bhai Hilai and Hilai-khar were invented in China.” However, whether the Ahoms were the inventors of Hile, and gunpowder or not, Jean Rap Tita Tewarniwar Chahar says that the Ahoms made Hile-khar—“It is believed that it is the same people who, in ancient times, first discovered gun-powder and guns; Gean Baptista Tavernier - This Is The Reason Why</content>

<content>There is no doubt that the Ahom days were skilled. Jean Baptiste Terrnier in his Travels in India (or &amp;#39;Travels in India&amp;#39; ) writes that the houses of the Kalaikhars whom Mirjula took Sanga to the dead seas in Assam are good. He adds that the salt roots were finely rounded like French salt and sharper than other salts. The salts of our country were not as long as those of the Bhutanese countries. This salt was made in the salt house by the hands of the Kharghar people under the supervision of the Kharghar Fukan; and it is understood that it was made in considerable quantities. When Mirjumlai returned from Assam, he looted our salt depots and took away 340 ounces of salt and 1,960 barrels of salt crushed with two and a half ounces of salt. There are many ways to get a job in the field of architecture, but the most important thing is to get a job in the field of architecture There is a lot to learn from this. Apart from the various types of cannons made in Assam, foreign guns and cannons also came to the treasuries of the Ahom kings. In 1454, the Ahom army captured many large and small hills from the Muslims after driving Turbak across the Karatwa River. In 1541, the mighty army of Pratap Singh (or Old King) defeated Syed Babakar and took away several iron and brass guns and cannons. In the month of Falgun 1580, Sandikey&amp;#39;s Tongchu Barbarua received 20 Kamayan hills and 300 Tubuki hills from Nathulla. During the sepoy mutiny in the month of Ahin in 1779, Captain Luther and Captain Bishar found a small French-made gun at the house of Charing King Kandarpeswar Singh in Jorhat. It was bought from Bengalhat in When the Hindustani Barkandas, in the days of His Majesty Gaurinath Singh, joined forces with Krishna Narayan of Daral and made trouble in the kingdom of Assam, the Rajamantri Purnananda Buragohain sent some troops against them; But they didn&amp;#39;t know how to drive well. Therefore it became difficult for our army to suppress the Barkandaz. Seeing no alternative, Gaurinath Singh sought the help of Lord Cornelius. Lord Cornwallis sent Captain Oles at the request. He came to us, formed a platoon of 500 Assamese soldiers under the formation of an Assamese platoon of an English captain, gave them some foreign guns and ammunition and made them kalaikhar (gunpowder) according to the British rules.</content>

<content>They taught the Ahom to practice their ancestors and religion. It was with this platoon that Gaurinath Singh Bargder subdued the enemies of Assam. Later, the king, unable to repel the outside attack, again asked the British Government for help. This time Lord Cornelius did not keep such a platoon of English captains, but prohibited the supply of some handguns and salt at an annual rate to form an army at the king&amp;#39;s discretion. In February 1793, when this was banned, many Badali and European sahibs established a market in Bengalhat. Through that market they exported goods worth about two hundred and eighty thousand rupees annually to Assam ; Assamese also exported goods and gold worth Rs. 151,000 annually. At this point, European merchants began selling many guns and necklaces in the market without the knowledge of the government. Therefore, it is important to understand the importance of gold in the country. Therefore, it is important to understand the importance of gold in the country. The French hand-barreled gun found in the house of the Charing king mentioned above is also a remnant of a gun purchased in this way. Our king was fascinated by foreign guns and moved around countless Assamese guns and a lot of gold. and when he was able to find out by trading such particles, he thought that he had found a pearl by giving it to Shokota, and he stopped building cannons in his kingdom. Therefore, it is necessary to take into consideration the fact that the present invention is not limited to the field of physics. Thus the art of making cannons disappeared forever in our country. 860 Art in the days of the Ahoms Assam is a field of colors, Assam is a gem-bearing country, Assam is a “blooming crop with fruitful crops”. There is no denying that the necessities of human life, which are generally required for subsistence, were in our country enough to support ourselves, even if they were not produced here to export. There are many ways to get a job There is no doubt that he enjoyed the property at home without touching anything. Assam is a land of gems; The sands of the rivers of Assam, the soil of Assam contain gold, silver, iron, etc., and they were reduced in the days of the Ahom kings</content>

<content>There are many examples of these characters in the books of the Ahoms. There were several castes in Sonwal&amp;#39;s games, such as Kachari, Bihia, Koch and Keot. They are the Kachari Sonwal and Bihiy Sonowal was the chief; There were some postmen in Keot Sonwal. They are the Ahoms, Rakhials and Barsonwals by caste Ahom. There are many ways to get a job, but the most important thing is to get a job. There are many ways to get a job, but the most important thing is to get a job. The Kachari Sonwals formerly lived in the southern region towards Shadia. and he made gold in the river Sovansiri. The right to reduce the salt in the Brahmaputra River belonged only to the Bihia Sonwalbils. No other goldsmith had the right to get off there. The Keot Sonwals reduced the sosh in small rivers like Rorai, Bargang, Padma, Hisai (Bhogdai ). Nowadays, this Keot-Sonwal clan is extinct; Their descendants are known in society as the “Good Kaystha from Kanauj” or “Bhuyanpawali” of the Rarbhuyan clan.Some goldsmiths who minted silver in the Dhansiri River were called “Thelal”. They were formerly worshipers of the goddess Tatreshwari of Shadia. In the days of Maharaja Gadadhar Singh, the authorities of Auniati Satra, Keshavder Gorami, gave them sharan bhajan and brought them to the path of Vaishnavism. They are located in Khorang, Shadia, Ahom Pathar, Pani Dihing Gharbandi, Jagun, Ratanpur, Jaipur, Dhala, Bihalimukh [and Thegal Mouzas There are 1. Bar Sonwal, 3. Koch Sonwal, and 5.

<content>The Ahom are the ethnic and religious groups of the Bar Shaikia, Laruparia, Sakgaya, Jiwamaria, Nagakhelia, Obalganga, Shannamaria, Bangala (or elephant-neck) Nalbari, and Kharikatia (or Tetonga). Although the Kachari Sonwals and the Kench-Sonwals have the same roots, the Koch Sonwals move separately from the Kachari Sonwals. They play four games: Northern Koch (or Northern Kuchia), Southern Koch (or Southern Kuchia), Dhulial, and Amrabari. Among these are the Bar Shaikia of Bihia Sonwal, the Banganya (or Elephant Neck) and Tetonganya, the Baharia and Bar Sonwal clans of Kachari Sonwal, which many think to be the same as the Koch Sonoraj, but this is not true. The Bihiras are Ahom. Rihiy Along with Sonwal, Ekhar Niri also cut soap, and Ekhar Daflai also worked gold, these two| The house is currently impressed along with Bihial. There are 14 main dynasties (not games) of the Koch Sonwals, each dynasty having a specific job. In the days of the Ahom kings, there was one Baroa, five Hazarikas, seven Shaikias and three Bora officers who supervised the work of Kachari Sonwals and Keot Sonwals. These things happened in the days of King Purandara Singh. The Kachari Sonwals, who came with Gohai Kamala, the brother-in-law of King Naranarayan, when they built the road on the north bank of the Brahmaputra, were divided according to their work only while they were in Shadia. Their main place of worship is the “Budhabudhi” shale in the northeastern corner of Shadia. They worship the god Vastu. There are many Koch kings like Naranarayan Chilarai who are mentioned in the names of their fathers. twelve days according to Kshatriya custom They obey uncleanness, and they “reply” to some. ✔aa The Auniati Satradhikar “Dattader Goramiedur refers to these four Koch Sonwals as “Rajbanshi Kochs” They are also a part of the Kachari goldsmiths.They are also part of the Kachari goldsmiths.They are eroded by the strong currents of the river The rule of reducing gold is determined by the village headman of the goldsmiths living on the banks of the Budhidihing</content>

<content>There are many ways to get away from these things , but the most important thing is to get away from these things Then reduce the gold With tools, etc., the gamers take them to reduce the soap. But when the goldsmith went to the gold mine, he took away the gold-mining equipment; And when they see signs of gold somewhere, they start reducing it. Four golden pikes gather together at the place where the gold is to be mined. These four pikes were called &amp;#39;pali&amp;#39; and the person who guided them was called &amp;#39;pati&amp;#39; This group of people mines gold in a rope, that is, the rope is a group of people. One of the four shifts washes the rallies, two carry the sand to the dorni with a stick, and the rest eat the sand. When they want to dig gold, they first dig it with a nest stick like a beer; When they arrived, they found a slab of hard sand at the bottom and picked up some of it with a bamboo stick. Then, when they look at the sand and see that there is gold powder or gold nuggets, they immediately start digging gold on the edge of the stick or in the water. The straight shade crosses the deep part of the stream ; If it is a small stream, it is filled with sand and if it is a large stream, it is filled with garbage. When the bridge is thus struck, the current turns over the gold-mining chalk, washes away the top layer, and removes the sand layer mixed with gold and pebbles. Then the goldsmiths break down the walls. When the wall is broken, the water comes back to its original place. They carry the sand with a wooden stick and put it in a basket. This stick is half a cubit long and a cubit wide, and it has a four-cubit-long reed. with two holes in the inner corners ; With the rope inserted through it, two men grab the rope from the front and start stirring the leheti. And one presses the edge of the leheti behind it into the rally. This is how the sand is pressed and put in danger. Then the sand is placed in the flood on the rope. The rope is wooden, three cubits long, one cubit wide, and the wall is about three cubits wide. Then, one lights a hollow pitcher with one hand and pours water, with the other hand stirring the sand of the flood, giving the mixture of kutakatiro. When I’m washing the sand in the rope When the water and sand fill up, the rope is given a little alone. This is done to remove the gold-mixed sand from the bottom of the pot Leheti and Dorani</content>

<content>The Ahom ancestral and religious arts, which are cut or bad, slip through the tunnel. If the sand is thrown into the 40/50 row, it is called &amp;#39;vein&amp;#39; in Sonwalite. In Asia, they don&amp;#39;t think they can reduce their losses overnight, because they can only produce so much gold by reducing it day by day, even with twelve folds. If it is in a place where it has not been done for five or six years, when| There are more than four losses in Shia. As such, it is about a pound of gold a day. They spread a cotton ball at the mouth of the hole in the rope and sprinkle water from the bucket on the gold and sand. When this is done, the sand comes out, and the gold sticks to the cotton. Then the gold is slowly removed, put in a pot, stirred or soaped. Then gold is spent in ordinary rallies. He looked at the gold in the furnace again ; They add as much mercury as there is gold. They mix gold and mercury. They mix gold and mercury and pour water. When water is found, it binds the gold with the mercury. Then the infantry They are picked up, put in a piece of snail shell, and heated over a fire of palm wood. With fatigue, the mercury flies away and the shell becomes soup. The gold fold-dependence is then tested by dropping it into water. They are considered to be flat if they fall into the water and folded if they are flooded. When the gold ladle is brassy in colour, the ground of the house is muddied with gold water and the mud is applied to the gold ladle fire In addition to this rule, some Kachari goldsmiths wait for the river to rise. They are the ones who have lost their water He came out of the rally ready to cut gold. The goldsmith of the Rydjia mail climbs the mountains and gathers cotton ; and he puts the cotton and reduces the gold as mentioned above. The days of gold mining in the Dichang River are short There are many ways to get a job in the field of architecture They dig up seams and forests, wash them and reduce the gold from them. Magh, Falgun, Chat, these dry months are usually the days to reduce gold. In some places, it is also grown in the autumn and winter. The goldsmiths unload gold on Jausi, Ekadashi, Purnima, Sankranti etc. There are many ways to get away from these things, but the most important thing is to get away from these things.

<content>The days of the Ahoms are much brighter than the gold found in the Brahmaputra and other rivers. As the river flows through the mountains, it is joined by a picture of the Himalayas. Therefore it is said, Seeing that this gold is produced from the diamond of the festival of Turi, it is pure necklace Uddan. Good gold is usually found in mountain rivers. The stronger the river, the brighter its golden nuggets. There are folds in the gold of the river. Jungle gold is very fine, pure and shiny. Besides the Brahmaputra and Dikring rivers, the Luit, Dihing, Topani, Parura Dihang, Dibang, Digak, Chal, Dichang, Dibuk, Sovanshiri, Dibhu, Kakai, Kadam, Soshdiri, Kharai, Barai, Bargang, Bardwikhri, Bharali, Manshiri, Kalijuri, Gold was mined in Dankajuri, Padma, Garura, Manaha, Budhiganga, Diche, Jaglu and many smaller rivers. Many goldsmiths earned their living by digging gold in these rivers. The number of goldsmiths in the days of Bargder Chakradhar Singh was over forty thousand, and in the days of Gaurinath Singh about sixteen thousand goldsmiths. Be sure to slow down how much soap the goldsmiths reduced. However, it is known in detail from history, rirani, and royal records that in the days of Singh, who came to the treasury of King Chakradhar, there were about five thousand vols in the treasury Gold came. In the days of Rajeshwar Singh, the amount of gold in the south was six or seven thousand tols per month Sosh was laid in the king&amp;#39;s treasury as a surplus. In the days of His Majesty Gaurinath Singh, you took four thousand tolas of salt from the goldsmiths became. Before the roar of Swatis Singh in Assam, when Purnananda Rudhagohai was the ruler of the Dalria kingdom, two thousand tolas of gold was levied annually as tax from the goldsmiths of southern Assam. The whole of South Assam came under British rule on the north bank of the Brahmaputra. When the tax was levied on the four hundred Sonwal Pikes, 150 or 160 groups of Mamuh Sonwal fell to the last king of Assam, Purdar Singh Bargade. When the Ahom kings broke up, there were eighty or three hundred in the country of Barsenapati, besides Sonwal, in Bishwanath and Sonari Chapari. Mr. Pemborton says that in the last year of the reign of Kamaleshwar Singh, in 1809, 180,000 Bholas were expelled from the Baibilas of Assam in many places.</content>

<content>The Ahom are divided into ten or fifteen groups of ethnic and religious groups, in Lithuri, Kolonichuk and Mardi. There were some. There were about fifty-yati households in Nadia and Saikhawa. During the reign of the Ahom kings, most of the Sonwals traveled along the north bank of the Brahmaputra. There were so few on the southern bank that only 23 houses of Sonwals remained when the king broke up. These are also the Sing, Sondhani, Chatia of southern Assam; Gold also came from the place called Chagari to the king&amp;#39;s treasury. In addition to the burden, the king&amp;#39;s companions also brought gold from the mountain of votes. sea Gold Taxes During the reign of the Ahom kings, the following rates were levied on the goldsmiths. At the end of the year, each pike pays one tola of gold to his player Bora or Shaikia. Uttamaridha for gold, pay taxes in addition. Three ratis for the best kind of salt, four ratis for the middle kind, and six ratis or one anna of gold for the soft kind should be left as an additional tax. In addition, for every forty tolas of gold, Barura Fukan received one tola, Tekela Bora received one tola and Bhandar Kakati received one tola. When taxes are paid in gold in the royal household, each tola of gold takes the form of five great forms of Chankakati, Bhandari, Ligira Panchani and Kukurachawa Barura Thus the king&amp;#39;s The goldsmiths did not express any dissatisfaction, although they had to pay taxes to the doorkeepers; Instead, he considered it a great benefit. The goldsmiths&amp;#39; job is to gather salt. Therefore they always make gold They carried their tools with them. The goldsmiths&amp;#39; tools looked messy, the work boring and lazy, but in reality the goldsmiths did not think so. Captain Henney in 1836 on his way to Jaipur He met Ejum Sonwal who was going to fetch salt from the mountains. This Sonwalbhum, hearing that there was a goon in the Budhidihing river, stayed there for a month and gathered 20 men and reduced the twelve ana (three great) sosh. The goldsmiths&amp;#39; eyes are sharp when they measure the place where salt comes from. Until the time when our country came under the control of the British, gold mining was a national occupation. With the arrival of the British, the profession rose to prominence. There were only two tests conducted in the British army. In 1884: the government and once again a couple of European tea farmers. For the first time, the 52 toss rally of the Poshanshiri River was two 42 ounces</content>

The second time Similarly, tea farmers have thrown lakhs of rupees into the water but have not been able to get the loans as expected. The thekals spoke of the form in the same way. Silver was found in the ravines of the Dhansiri River, and almost there most of the silver was found. became. Goldsmiths work in gold, silver and language. There is a separate caste called Sonari in other provinces of India but (at least in the southern region ) the Sonaris cannot be called a separate caste. The goldsmiths who came with Sondar Gohain from Kochbehar in the days of Maharaja Buddhi Barganarayana Bargade were, however, of the goldsmiths&amp;#39; family. But when our country came into contact with them, the golden nation gradually disappeared The test seems to be that the Sonari Khan umbrella man is married. They are often the descendants of the Kalitas and Kayastha people of good descent. Rahuho of the Ra Bhuyan clan is also known to be among the goldsmiths. There were goldsmiths here before Buddhivarganarayana Maharaja of Bargader. History, however, is made up of that. Mr. Henniker. ICB writes :&amp;quot;There were goldsmiths in the country in the old time, and their work was not fine.&amp;quot;-Gold and Silver Wares of Assam The ornaments were not as attractive as those of other countries. So Kadra Singh Bargade sent his mahuh to Bhati Jaipur and Banach (Kani) to teach him goldsmithing. Good side man from Banaras| Some of the goldsmiths were also bored. and many of the craftsmen and craftsmen of the land of Assyria were taught goldsmiths by them. Our northern goldsmiths of the present day are often their descendants. After 2/3 years of the reign of Pramabha Singh Bargade, a small conspiracy was revealed against him. Therefore, it is important to understand the importance of these issues. Therefore, it is important to understand the importance of these issues.

<content>The Ahom were very fond of their ancestry and religion. Kirti Chandra Barbarua was then the Chief Minister of the State and his unbroken glory. He took that Bhuyan chick out, the chicken thief of Rangpur They hid it near the king, in the satra of the Gosai of Dihing. Barbarossa himself gave it was a child of Sajare (now. His descendants are servants of Dihingre ). At that time, an order was issued from the royal court that anyone who wished could learn goldsmithing. The Haris are disciples of Dihing; They were trained by three goldsmiths named Buhujur, Latua and Gutia by the Satradhikar of Dihit Satra at that time, Kaivalananda Gosa. Therefore, it is important to understand the importance of these factors in the development of the country&amp;#39;s economy. From there, the movements of the Bhuyans Someone, someone. It is known that he was involved in the goldsmith game. Besides, the king captured many of the Bhuyanpawalis involved in the above-mentioned conspiracy and threatened to sacrifice them to Gosani, some of whom surrendered. Some of them the king sent away, and the chief of them was made overseer of the goldsmiths in the city of Garhwal, so that they might not conspire in the future. His descendants should be considered as goldsmiths even if they do not work as goldsmiths. Nowadays, although there are goldsmiths among the Kochs, Keots, Chutia, Haris and many other castes, goldsmiths refer only to the descendants of the Kayastha Kalitas of that good lineage. Mr. Hanniker Chahar in his “Gold and Silver Wares of Assam&amp;quot;v writes :-“Rajah Rudra Singh of Assam imported goldsmiths from Benaras to teach Assamese how to manufacture better sorts of gold and silver ornaments lucrative, and there being no check to any people taking any trade or profession during the last days of the Ahom Rajah, the people of other castes, such as Keots and Koches, learned the work and became sonaries: so rich that they were made Hazarikas and Saikias (head of a &amp;quot;Thousand&amp;quot; and a &amp;quot;Hundred&amp;quot; respectively of their own community).</content>

<content>In the Ahom days, these goldsmiths had several games, and each game had a different palace and three “shals” with different names. Rudra Singh Swargade taught at Bhati Jaipur and appointed two other men who could do good works as “Rajshal” and gave them the title of Bardoli. They lived in Charigar near Jorhat. In the days of Rajeshwar Singh Swargadeo, another &amp;quot;Rajshan&amp;quot; was established for Latura Bardoli; Latura Bardoli lived in Kendugur (near Jorhat ). These three were called &amp;quot;Rajshan&amp;quot; and these three clans of goldsmiths are called &amp;quot;Rajbhagiya Sonari&amp;quot; Their chief was Choladhara Fukan. They were to make all the royal ornaments, including the royal ornaments of the royal treasury. Another new canal was created during the reign of this king ; It is called “Silver Shawl”. Earlier, this human activity was done in the palace of Kecham. This is Rupamar| The chief of the shal was Cyril, Fukan, and the four tribes were subordinated to the Bardoli of this shal; The first are some of the comers, who hammer and help the bardoli while beating the silver, the second, a game of kaiward; They spend silver, one is a goldsmith, they make silver plates, and the fourth is a Muslim; They cut letters.

Their names are, Taofkia, Kalangpuria, Bhatiaparia, Kalugan, Rajhub There are 1000+ people in the country. The late goldsmith is dedicated to the temple; They work in the temples, and they are also known as “Nirmalikatia”.

With keen intelligence, continuous effort, and timely care, it is not difficult to recover them. Therefore, it is necessary to take measures to ensure that the productive forces of nature are increased. Therefore, it is necessary to take measures to ensure that the productive forces of nature are increased. Iron is the most prominent of these resources in the world today. Without iron, the throne of the Lord of the seas, the unbroken glorious protector, would shake. It will be briefly explained how this iron was formerly mined in Assam to increase the prosperity of the state, and how, under what circumstances, the rules of mining disappeared forever. It is located in the southern part of Shivsagar (formerly Rangpur) district, on the slopes of the Naga Mountains Up to Basa-Daiyaz, this whole piece was a fire-burning iron-pung Good iron was mined at Tiru village and Hatigarh, near the Tiru hill on the banks of the Jaji river, fifteen miles straight from the old Rangpur city, and at Kacharihat. When the snow falls in the autumn and winter, or when the drought begins, the people of Lo-Shali go and build rice houses. Each shawl is worked by a teacher and four shifts to produce raw iron in a day. He worked in this way for six months and handed over what he had earned to the king&amp;#39;s house. In the days of Purnananda Buragohain Dazria, there were only 30 or 40 iron canals in Tirugaon and Hatigarh; There are many ways to get a job in the field of architecture They brought clay, dug it up, and ground it into iron. rainy waves lo—shalya calicoes and other stuffs with, and when they have extracted this red color they use the lac to lacquer cabinets and other objects of that kind and to make Spanish Wax. A large quantity of it is exported to China and Japan, to be used in the manufacture of cabinets; it is the best lac in the whole of Asia for these purposes. As for the gold, no one is permitted to remove it out of the Kingdom, and it is...... kept in large and small ingots, which the people make use of in local trade not taking it elsewhere, but as for silver, the King Coins it into money of the size and weight of rupees. 1676</content>

<content>When the Ahom Eastern and Religious rises, the waters of the Dayaj Rachani eat the crushed soil mixed with lavachu from the mountains and we hide in places a piece of fatigue. They are then covered with sediment ; In the dry season, the iron-workers dig to a depth of 10, 12, 15, 16 feet, and when they reach the soil, a teacher and five shifts work in groups for four or five days They take out the land. Two of the five shifts dig the soil mixed with the lower lavachu, one lifts the soil from below to the mouth of the hole, one brings it out, and one brings the dug soil. Thus, the five Pali and one Oja gather together and dig out a thousand yogas of soil every ten days. After the land is dug and removed, it is divided into seven parts, one part belongs to the landlords and the remaining six parts are divided among the workers. Then everyone throws their share of the piles of soil into a deep canal with water and drags it for 10/12 days. As you stir, the porach mixed with the khech, khechira soil automatically separates. This separated part is taken and ground according to the following rules. They build a three-storey house 16/17 feet high to fall on the ground behind the water. The inside of the house is about 20 cubits long and 10 cubits wide. They build a ditch in the middle room, and burn the soil. They burn it, put it in an empty pot and start beating it hard. At the blow of thee his garments are foamed out, and the iron-mixed clay is loaded with bridges. They are shaken with a knife, cut with a knife, cut with a stick, or thrown into a tree to make it long and flat. When making ordinary iron, Pathota people work in the iron canals. The work of the carpenter is to bring in the straw to bring the kiln, and to take the iron out of the fifteen parts of the burnt clay that is taken to the kiln, and to make it into a shape. The teacher should also throw away the soil mixed with Lorachu. Apart from this Ojapali, there are people who eat rice with two hands; One of them hits the ground. They bring about five rupees of clay from the other and throw it to two. They worked day and night and one day they were in a bowl</content>

The following rates are used to extract one hundred yogas of iron from the ground at Rasa Dairad. was - Gerekua soil pulsura chat seeking ra lo-pung extraction— soil digging— taking soil separation— laga man days • BO 10. The Garos brought and sold iron ore at Palashbari and Gohai-hat in Koma. Our people from the south went and exchanged them for coconut shells, rice, rice, soybeans and made them into ploughshares, nails, bars, piercings, bottles, bais, coconut shells, puppet kites and hill shafts. The iron extracted from Jaipur to Dayang made sharper axes, swords, hills, cannons and spears. The blacksmith took the clay out of the ground and made it iron; He made it with a carpenter and cheated it to make it suitable for use. Nowadays, you can&amp;#39;t tell if there are any lost people; At least: not usually seen ; There are places where the workers are; But it is very sad that they are slowly giving up the work of blacksmiths and the sons of blacksmiths are ashamed to be called blacksmiths nowadays. It is difficult to say with certainty whether the southern coast of southern Assam, before the arrival of the Ahoms, was in this country. In 1422, the Ahom king Bargade of Dihingia captured the Chutia kingdom and captured a large number of blacksmiths besides items such as dolas, kali, golden drums, golden hatas, golden three-cornered thrones, etc. The king sent some of them to Rosa and others to the south of Bahubale and set up workshops to make knives, knives, scythes, and cannons. They appointed Hazarika and Shaikia to see the good and bad of the work among them. It is only from the days of the Dihingia kings that the blacksmith trade started in our country. He was a blacksmith in the Chutia kingdom, but could not become famous for his work</content>

<content>The Ahom&amp;#39;s ancestry and religion began to grow in prestige only after they came to power. In the days of the Dihingia king, we had three thousand workers here. Besides these, Pratap Singh or Budharaja Bargade brought many workers from the mines to make brass hills and barbhops in the style of the mines in our country and recorded their various games. Until the days of Gaurinath Singh, iron was extracted from the ground by iron-smiths, and knives, swords, hills, bullets, etc. were made by blacksmiths; The country was devastated by the Moammars, and the people moved away, and there was a shortage of iron miners. Immediately, the workers began to build and beat the sides. In the days of Purnananda Buragohain Bhalria, only 500 five hundred blacksmiths and iron-slingers remained. In the days of the Mans, it fell even further to a hundred. In 1750, there were only 60 or 50 households from Lo-Pung Chini in Shivsagar district. Therefore, the iron-clad people are now completely extinct. There are many games that still exist today, but these are the main ones—Dhekragadha, Hololaparia and Katniparia. These workers once made so many firearms in our country that Mir Jumla, the chief commander of the Emperor&amp;#39;s army, made so many weapons of fire in our country They left Dhaka and reached the border of Assam. They hid their hands and feet in their stomachs, thinking that the king of Assam had numerous hills and a cannon capable of firing 500 bullets at once; And all the guns and cannons he took with him when he returned from Assam were to hide his hands and feet. They are also known as Kalita people, but some are called Saru Kalita and others are called Kama Kalita. The blacksmith trade has now spread to many other nations. When digging ponds and patnads, everyone has seen that a black soil appears below 20/25 feet and in places it is 3 if not dug so deeply, and such soil also appears in places on the banks of a river. This soil is used to build pots, pans, squares, ditches, canals, floods, etc. in our country. The potter makes the pots and pans of this clay; and the lands are probably also called potter&amp;#39;s lands after the name of the potter. These pottery are very useful and still in use not only in Assam, but throughout India; Therefore, it is not necessary to say much about it here.</content>

<content>In the Ahom days there were five divisions of the Turars, namely, Rajabhagiya, Biltira, Satrira, Derania, and Rajhaba Babhagiya, the princes were divided into six parts, one part was divided between the kings of Felkhowa and the princesses. They divide the Biltia Kumars among the officers of the branches and so do the Satriyas The chief of the Kumaras is divided into the main satras and the late Kumaras into the temples. In parts, these Kushars provide their respective pots, pans, dirt, and whatever is needed at any time. The public pottery section works for the people. Kumarrilak identifies himself as “Kumar Kalita” or “Kalita” man. This business is among the limited Kumars. For whatever reason, foreigners are not yet greedy for this business. The potters have a “wheel” on which they put clay and turn it to make pots and jars. There are mountains almost all over Assam and rock formations during the reign of many Ahom kings. SW Kato| He was a man. They were called “stone-cutters” or “stone-cutters.” They cut stones from the mountains and made stone bowls, potatoes, potato beads, pottery pots, stone jute pots, stone tablets, etc. These stones were used to make the stone tablets found in the temples today from the Ahom period; The letters were cut only by the hands of the scribes. These rock-cut pots and stone pat-nads can still be seen in places in Assam. The stones carved in the walls of Jaidaul are the glory of these stone huts. Very sad, the quarry business Nowadays, it is almost extinct in Assam. The stonecutters made a stone for testing gold, and the stone was called Kashati, and the people who made it were called Kashati. There was also a man called a miner. There were several divisions of the miners, and each division did a different job. One part made idols out of pottery; That part was usually known as the miner. They did not know how to make clay pots in this country before; There are many ways in which you can improve your self-confidence.

<content>They are the ancestral caste and religion of the Ahom. There were several Javars in this part, but the Ahoms are known to have been the majority. 863 Rachai The carpenters who split, peeled, cut, split, cut, and made wooden tools were called “Badhe” or “Rachai carpenters”. The handiwork of the carpenters of this country, however, is incomparable to that of the provinces of Panjar and others; But our country is rich in many valuable timbers, and that is why these carpenters and miners of our country tried hard to use those timbers. In the days of the earlier kings Bargadevas, these radhai-rimikars were usually more religious than the daily necessities of the people and were associated with the thrones of religious temples, kirtan ghars and gosani ghars He was very interested in making statues. and he received much encouragement from the king&amp;#39;s household. Even today, such wooden idols of Garuda, Anant, Halusapta, etc. can be seen in the great satras of Dann like Auniati, Dakshinpat, etc., and they also give some insight into the craftsmanship of the carpenters of our earlier times. But that does not mean that our carpenters did not make the daily objects of the people out of wood. The wooden objects commonly used include paleng, chal-pira, barpira, karani, barpera, sarai, thagi, bay, dola, gacha, lakhuti, mako, fini, dor,pati, nachani, agnigarh, tolotha, tamuli-pira. This country has always had (and still has) many kinds of valuable timber. The woods used for such works include jackfruit, saral, nahar, chichu, uriam, garari, karai, vivaspa, vine, shal, chash, etc. Wooden Articles • The pride of the Assamese, Honorary Executive Council of the Governor of Assam, Mr. BA (Cal. and Cantab. ) LL.B.; Where did the actualization go as Chahar of CIE Barita says “The Hindus in Assam, as elsewhere are swayed by strong religious feelings, and one may say with Sir George Birdwood that everything that is mado is for direct religious use, or has some religious sentiment.&amp;quot; -Wood Carving.in Asia, Pagel.</content>

<content>In the Ahom days, there was a section of miners who worked on tree horns and elephant songs, called the “speakers” or “blood miners”. In the days of the Ahom Barganbers, the colors of ivory eggs, kakai, throne, karani, cellur tea, etc. were very popular among kings, bhangrias and officials like Barua-Phukan. The blood miners prepared whatever they needed. Mr. Van Chahar ( Mr. I. Donald I C. 8. ) in his &amp;quot;Monograph of Ivory Carving in These ivory-carvings were Muslims. Their kings gave them scholarships like Nihar land for this work; It’s a business. Now it is almost extinct. Mr. Don&amp;#39;s Dane wrote—+ Muslims mentioned above. And now it&amp;#39;s not. With his death, Jorhat is often the whole of Assam. There were many elephants in the elephants of the Ahom kings. These will be obtained from elephants. Wild besides teeth In short, there was no shortage of elephant tusks in the days of the kings and the speakers could not sit still. Therefore, they were forced to adopt other occupations for their livelihood as follows: ● &amp;quot;Once an important art in the days of the Ahom Rajahs, ivory carving has, since Assam came under British Rule, gradually declined. In those past times when industry threw off, the workers, known as Khanikars, worked solely for the Rajahs. This would seem to indicate that the work in those days was much valued.&amp;quot; ^ Bringing the information up to date, we may safely say that there is but one man in the whole of Assam whose occupation can be descived as &amp;quot;Ivory Carver the work of one man.&amp;quot;</content>

<content>The miners of the Ahom ancestry and religion disappeared in Assam. In addition, Mr. Donnell writes: 893 Although in the late Ahom kingdom. Some salt was also imported from abroad, but not from Assam There was enough salt in the mountains of this country to fill the people, but most of the mountains were concentrated in the Arr and Salt Naga Mountains, and our people were often unable to extract enough salt from the mountains. There are many different types of Losh Puja in Barhat and Sadia. The salt-worship of these two places, if not the whole of Assam, fed almost the majority of the people. There were also several salt wells in Namgarh. There was a man called Lonpuria in the days of the king. They went to the mountains of Ar and Naga, and the Nagas dug salt wells together, and brought out the salt water, and put it in the pots of the cockroaches, and burned it in the fire, and made salt. These salt beds are commonly called “long beds” nowadays. The burning of the salt was done at night. Of all the salt roasted in three nights, two parts remain with our people, and one part is taken by the Abarei or Nagas, on whose mountains the salt is roasted. In the days of our Kamaleshwar Singh Bargade, in 1809, the salt-mines of Gadia alone produced Rs. 40,000-20,000 per annum. Under the Rajshs the work was not altogethe ran optional one. There was a compulsory element. Care was taken to see that each man was kept busy at his trade; while at the same time the means of livelihood were certain. With the disappearance, however, of the Rajahs, these influence ceased. The carvers, who had land and cattle, settled down principally to a life of agriculture, a life involving little labor on their part, yet insuring a comfortable living. Not pressed by force to earn his livelihood, the ivory carver took no steps to push his industry, or to create a demand. An occasional order for an article in ivory would generally be executed at a pro fit so considerable that the workman could afford to lay aside his tools for some time, before undertaking another commission. What was the result of this? What as spasmodic in the parent became despised by the child, he saw in it merely a secondary means of livelihood, demanding long and much perseverance, with no immediate prospect of prosperity. Their inclinations, if of good family, tended, as in the case of the son of Fiznoor, the well-known carver in Jorhat, towards an office stool&amp;quot;. - Ivory Carving in Assam Page 2.&amp;quot;</content>

<content>The roasted salts from the Ahom bins were many times better and more valuable than the hated salts from abroad. At that time, about 100,000 yoga salts were imported from abroad Poor loss was common only among the upper classes. An artificial loss was used among the poor and common people. The French traveler Terrania Chahash wrote in this connection—† 892 That is (in short) the Assamese people lost artificially and there were two methods of logging. First, a type of puni that floats in cooking water (such as beaches) and is eaten by high-vefuli is collected. They burn them, wrap their ashes in a broken ear and boil them in water. When the water evaporates while boiling, the salt is formed from the mud that falls to the bottom. Apart from this rule, there is another method of losing, which is this :– The leaves of the fig tree (Adams Fig ) are burnt by the sprouts. The ashes also yield a kind of salt, and the salt is so sharp that it cannot be used unless it is somewhat grinded. &amp;quot;Salt......appears to be obtainable from springs in the province, which the Assamese, however, are never able to bring efficiently into play, from the unfriendly and unsettled state of that part of the country in which they are principally situated that imported from Bengal.......&amp;quot; + &amp;quot;......what is manufactured, which is done in two ways. The first is to collect vegetable inatter which is found in stagnant water such as ducks and frogs eat of the large leaves the kind of fig tree, which we call Adam&amp;#39;s fig. They are dried in the same manner and burnt, and the ashes from them consist of a kind of salt which is so pungent that it is impossible to eat unless it is softened three times through a cloth and then boiled, and when the water is all consumed, the salt which is white and fairly good is found at the bottom of the pot white silk is much more valuable than the other, but they have not sufficient to clean half the silks which are produced in the country.&amp;quot; - Travels in India By JB Travernier</content>

<content>The ashes are soaked in water for ten or twelve hours to cleanse or remove the choke. The water is then boiled three times with a cracker and the juice is boiled until it becomes thick. When the water evaporates, some white spots fall on the well. Those are the salt. There are many ways to get a job in the field of architecture, but the most important thing is to get a job in the field of architecture There was a belief that rice was white like snow when washed with silk (jute, velvet, etc.). If there were these egg trees in abundance in Assam, the Assamese people would have washed and whitened all their residual clothes, but there are not enough egg trees to wash the middle of all the silk produced in the country. Hila-khar, Yaraksha It has been said that Hila-khar was made in Assam long before it and it is believed by many that it was first discovered by the Ahoms. There are many different types of characters in the film, but the most important one is the character of the heroine. With the extinction of the ancients and the absence of any written records, it is difficult to say how these salts were prepared. It is said that in the days of the king, there was a large barn meeting of the branches, where about six consecutive cows (especially black cows) were rescued and killed. The cow urine is allowed to be disposed of in the barn. When the cows die in this way for six months, they are left to tie the cows there, and the house is left naked for about a year. Then a fine white substance (not fruit) appears on the base of the barn without the fungus. The rags were somehow used to make braksha, and Fatimahira cut down the palm trees, burned them, and somehow made salt from the salt. They are now almost destroyed because of our people&amp;#39;s own faults, what have they been destroyed forever. Everyone has seen the big ponds like Radimia Shivsagar, Jaisagar etc. in Rangpur ( present Shivsagar sub-division). One of the characteristics of these ponds is that although the surrounding areas are much shallower than the banks and the water in those places is often as flat as the banks, only Kaching causes fever. The present-day British engineers have also noticed such characteristics of the Assamese Mamuse Khana Pudhuri in the days of the Ahom Barjas</content>

They were settled near the field called Rah-Chala in the present Golaghat sub-division. The water in the ponds is always clear, there is a saying that there is not much rice, and it is very good to see fish flying around. After digging a pond, the language suggests that mercury or “stay” is placed at the bottom of the pond according to the measurement of the pond. It has the property that it cuts the dirt of the water and does not allow the water to boil too much. The inventor of the pond is an Assamese Brahmin. His house is called “Rasendra&amp;#39;s house”. Among the descendants of that fame, Mr. Dereshwar Rakra of Raichahar, Jorhat is a famous man Sadly, they don&amp;#39;t know anything about it now The Ahom kings paid special attention to the raising of jute larvae, yuga and edi, and the weaving of clothes with their yarn, which was very advanced in those days. The kings not only encouraged this industry in every way, but also forced everyone to make some clothes or cut yarn every day without burden. In addition to forcing the jute-raising Jahuh to cut down the honey trees under the pressure of their rari, they were given tax-free land from the royal household for the Muni tax In the same way, he forced the people near the Chomni to raise the Yuga and gave the Chomni as seed. Whoever had 34 females in his household, especially if there were half-hearted or old women, were allowed to raise heels and the raba-shaikia of the Mopohe game had to take good care of them. It was during this time that the year advanced in the development of this industry.

<content>Three-quarters of the people wear Ahom ancestral and religious clothes. Yuga yarn and jute yarn are also exported in large quantities. Every two Virutas may have one weaving mill, and a Daz family may have eight or ten. Every family cuts and weaves their own velvet and jute yarn...they are used as jute and mekhela and made in different sizes suitable for different purposes.” In the days of the kings (however, even today) jute clothes were very expensive and welcome and jute turbans were mostly worn by the common people, but some also wore silk scarves and silk garments. They are the ones who raise jute larvae and make jute yarn. They are the only ones who raise jute larvae. They eat the leaves of beautiful trees with jute larvae Not to mention, the jute-pollinators do not give the yuga, mejankari, chapa-pat to other people on Mondays, no one&amp;#39;s caste goes there, the yuga eats the leaves of the chom tree (the leaves of sowalu and dighalati can also be picked up velvet ).

<content>The Ahom days are called Eri. In the days of the king, every old man and every woman who did not spin for a certain number of days was punished; Therefore, the country produced a large amount of silk and silk cloth. According to the Ahom, the Ahom or Tai languages are called Khuluh, and “Chip, It,-Tyaochil” from the descent of Khunlai to the arrival of King Chukapha in the land of Sauma. That is, 660 years; But these 660 years are only with the 70 years of enjoyment of Dhunulai. Both the originals, the Kangia and the Ahom, write the year in vaochinga, but it seems to be a mistake not to put hundreds or thousands in it, yet the namecase of a year within the year is also written as &amp;quot;lucky&amp;quot; roll. Taochitra In Hindu scriptures, every year is considered auspicious and inauspicious according to the name. At the end of 60 years, he starts again with the beginning of the cycle; However, in secular and disciplinary terms, the number and name of the year of Shankaditya is 1760 AD and 1761 AD. Thus the war, the Kangia Ahmians named the 60 years Tyaochila, Lej, (or Neng, ) Tyaochinga, Chal,-Tyaochinga, Cham-Dyaochida. When you first catch it, you catch a 30-day fish.

This rule was not considered convenient and later the “Cha” class was created to perform certain functions, and those subjects to monitor their functions was appointed. Thus the officer&amp;#39;s subordinate brief The people began to do only certain things. In the past, bows, arrows, and other weapons of war were used. The archers called them archers because they fought with them. When a card pike is a hunting game, it does not belong to the category of people who do all the work, because although the card does all the work, in order to make a card a hunting game, that card is admitted to a hunting game. In short, the king hands over the sword to the pike by taking it to a certain working class. There are several games or divisions of the Chamuas, such as Barbarura Chamua, Galal Chamua, etc. There are also names of games according to their occupation or occupation, such as goldsmith&amp;#39;s game, Bayon&amp;#39;s game, blacksmith&amp;#39;s game, bow-shooting game, etc. Very short The games are called the “mail” people of the officer under whose jurisdiction the games are collectively. For example, the goldsmith&amp;#39;s game of the Dhekyal Fukan&amp;#39;s mail. Sometimes they are played together in one place. There are many different types of jails, such as the Barfukan Jail and the Khagarijan Mail. There are no sports people together, they are scattered There is no infringement or rule of rights to the game. That game just has to keep working as specified. A man who does not do the specific work of his game, the mail is broken They hide and are called “fugitives”. There are also elephant-bearers, biltias, and house pikes among the Brahmins who are officers of the wire game.</content>

<content>Social behavior in the days of the king, however, is that they should not do such vile things as the wind should cut the grass with the hands of the grass instead of cutting the grass itself. Therefore, it is important to understand that the Brahmins of Biltia were not required to do any menial work like other Karis, but only to pick flowers in the houses of certain da-dangriyas or kings, wash meat and rice during pujas and festivals. There are still many Bamuns of the household of Barpathra Dangaria in Naharni and Kakdonga Mouzas of Golaghat sub-division; Cyril still follows the old rules, and they still sit on the ground before the descendants of Barpatra Bharia. There are elephant-dhahi Bamun, biltia bamun kari and samua specified census papers.

These slave traders were completely prohibited by the owner: they were not required to participate in any work of the king, and were also exempt from “taxes”, cuttles, positions, fifths, etc. They could be donated, conquered and transferred at will by the officer or owner. Their bases usually ranged from forty rupees per good for the best funniwa ghuni, to three rupees per bad for the bad, ie, the lowly tirobhai. They didn&amp;#39;t have to go to Ron, and the royal family There were no hands on them. Therefore, the prisoners were considered luckier than ordinary pies, so the lower classes of the Everors preferred to enter the houses of nobles and officials, rather than being classified as “swords” or “pikes”. and many of them came voluntarily, and bombed the houses of the nobles. Mills, sir, wrote – the Bengalis have to do all the menial work of the owner and the forest of the fields. In short, these Randrirechi were the hands and feet of the upper classes.

<content>The Ahom days begged the help of the Ahom kings. The old king Bargade helped him with a very strong army, and defeated the Muslims and named him Dharma Narayan, and saved him at the fort in 1614 AD. At the same time, Balitnarayan’s brother Gaj Narayan Beltline many is read. From Vevia, the two clans continued to serve as the Katlia kings of the Ahom. When Adityanarayan of the Darani clan was finally called in 1725, the Darani kingdom remained only in the present Mangaldai sub-division south of Gohaikamala Ali. There are many ways to get a job in the field of architecture, but the most important thing is to get a job in the field of architecture They take away the kingdom. From then on, the clan of the Darani king began to weaken, and eventually the Dargi king became completely subordinate to the Ahom king. Thus, after enjoying the kingdom for a while as subordinate kings, their condition became very bad. Finally, the Ahom king considered them incompetent, made them mere servants of the “king” khivape, who was not even from the ranks of the lower kings, and prohibited the granting of certain lowly land-scholarships for enforcement. The Beltala clan. With “king” in name, he became an employee of the Ahom king. Cyrilakke Nishkar land-scholarships are given to the initiators. The Dardi clan of Galal Gohain, and the Beltala clan of Barphukan, moved through it. LOD Seven-House Necklace Jatua Ahom “Ahom” is not the name of a variety or flower. Therefore, it is important to note that the present study is not only a study of the characteristics of the Ahom, but also of the characteristics of the Ahom. Ahom is the name of a community or people; There were various kinds (or races) of people among these tribes. There were kings among the Ahoms, as there were Morangchoa, Dharivari, etc. among the Ahoms. In short, Ahom is not the name of a clan or caste, and not all Ahoms are a class of Ahoms. The upper class Bhadrabanshi Ahoms are called &amp;quot;Datghari Ahoms. King Chukapha Bargade came down with the chief Sair of the seven houses. These seven houses were called the “Satghari&amp;quot; Ahoms.</content>

Ahe (in the days of the Dihitia king) the number of the seven-house Ahom was initially 12 houses, but then, when the subject of Barpatra was created, the number of the seven-house Ahom was increased to thirteen houses. Dihingira Balai converted 72 new households as “Jatura Ahom”. after the days of the heavenly gods called Dihingira The “Seven-House Ahom Records” remained unchanged until the beginning of the reign of Maharaja Jaidhwaj Singh Swargadeo. In 1654, Jaidhwaj Singh Maharaja publicly converted to Hinduism and first took refuge with Niranjan Bapu, the head of the Auniati Satra. Then, according to the tantra, he received the mantra from Banmali Deva of Dakshinpat. At that time, high-ranking officers and almost all the upper caste Ahoms began to convert to Hinduism. The Mohan, Bailul and Deodhais clung to their former customs and religions, and the Ahoms who introduced Hindu rules began to oppress them. Therefore, Maharaja Jaidhwaj Singh removed Mohan Deoai and Bailul from the ranks of the Satghari Ahoms and created a new nation as follows: 2. The king&amp;#39;s Bangaha. 2. Buragohain&amp;#39;s Bahuh, 3. Bargohai&amp;#39;s Rangah, (Nag. Barpatra). 5. The silver of the vessel. 6. Sandikoir (Adabari ) clan, 7. The tribe of Lahan. 8. The tribe of Duwara. 9.

<content>After the Ahoms conquered and expanded their kingdom in the days of the kings, Bakhakarya Munye gradually abandoned his Ahom, or Chai language for the sake of Chaladhar, and neglected his former religion and adopted the essence of Hinduism. Only Mohan, Deokhai, Railul and others followed their religion. There are many religions in the world, but the most important religion is the Ahom religion. At present it is unanimously acknowledged that the Ahoshas are very strong and 66 &amp;quot;They are superior to most nations in their bodily strength and power of endurance. They are enterprising......fond of war......if one of them should meet ten Muhammadans on foot, he will fearlessly attack them, and even be victorious.” – That is, the Ahoshas were superior to many nations in physical strength and endurance, that is, there were very few nations as strong and enduring as the Ahoms. An Ahom infantry could rely on ten Muslim infantry and win. The Ahoshas were as skilled in land warfare as they were in naval warfare It was like that. They did it several times They completely defeated the Muslims. In view of these, the Girilas deserve the status of Kshatriyas after converting to Hinduism. In the Gita, Lord Kṛṣṇa says, &amp;quot;I have created the fourfold world, which is divided into four parts, namely, the modes of nature and the modes of nature. But as soon as the Ahoms were deprived of royal power, Sati Ven lost his place. The Dutta family in Bengal says, “Dutta is not a servant of anyone, he has only come with us.” Just as the Bolas lost their nobility, the Ahoshas did not find a proper place in society because they did not work as “servants” in the houses of the Golai Bamuns.

<content>They did not pay attention to the days of the Ahom. They did not think that they would be captured so soon. To whom royal power, and Ian soon... such a decline will come. They did not dream that the day would come when their future descendants would be destitute of the ripe paddy of the fields, and would have to take refuge in the Gosai Bamun in search of a place in society After establishing a satra called “Aunimati”, making him its authority, f, many disciples and land scholarships like Debottar Brahmottar etc. ( enjoying these scholarships, the satradhikar of that satra can now live like a petty king ). If he drinks, he has taken away a hundred buckets of water from it, and it will be better for the Brahmins and others to drink the water of that well; and if the soft rice is touched by the Ahom or touched by the Ahom, it will not go to the Brahmins, etc. They certainly could not have imagined that after converting to Hinduism, the Gosai Brahmins would one day try to include them in the Antyajas; And the Gosai Brahmins will have a “claim” to the Hindu scriptures from accepting the gifts of the other caste but remaining eternally pure without being “fallen” and being able to lift people from hell to home by surrender, worship and hope. The Ahom, though a very powerful nation, did not oppress the people to convert to their Ahom religion, but adopted the religion and language of the people themselves, and showed such an example of compassion for the people that is rare in the history of other countries. Can anyone say that the Ahoms were very small in number, so what would they do without adopting the religion and language of the people? This conclusion, however, is not so accurate. A look at the history of India, the Muslim and British rule, shows how fertile that question is. Let that go. The seeds of Hinduism fell among the Ahoms in 1416 AD during the reign of King Chujang, Pha (Ra Bamuni Konwar), but it did not germinate until the reign of King Bargade of Dihingia. Before this, only Lakshmi Narayan was worshiped in the roof. Dihingia Hinduism began to spread in the Ahom kingdom from the days of the king, and he was the first to take the title of Swarganarayana and sow the seeds of Hinduism among the Hindu Ahoms in the country</content>

But that one (i.e. the Dihingia king ) or, someone after him. Bargade did not openly convert to Hinduism. In 1654, Jaidhwaj Singh Swargade ascended the throne. He was the first to be initiated into Hinduism, first at Auniati Satra and then, as mentioned in Bhantrokta, at Dakshinpat As I have said in the beginning of this book, it is described in the ancient Puranas when the Ahom kings first arrived in this country and established their kingdom in the Sauma region There are many reasons why the Brahmins of the Ahom period lived in Habu The Ahoms converted to Hinduism, learned Hindu customs and rituals, and understood the faults of the Habulia Bayuns. Therefore, the Hindu Ahom kings were well educated and green Brahmins from provinces like Kanyakubj or Kanauj There are many examples of these characters in the books of the Buddha. There is nothing wrong with the number of “Kanaujpuri Brahmins” whose descendants have voluntarily joined them, as it is only an indicator of national progress They are called “Kanaujpuri Brahmins” and “Assamese Ramuns” in the anger of Cyril Special favor and respect to Brahmins Habulia Bamun (pre-Ahom)</content>

(Today’s “Muklimuria Gosai”). These are the main ones. The four Gatras mentioned earlier are the chief religious authorities of the country. These four Natras follow the Bhagarat Shastra, and the Parvatira Gosai, Nri-Gosai and Muklimuria Bhattacharya, these follow the Tantra Shastra. Apart from these, other small satras were established during the reign of the Ahom kings. of those| Many were given scholarships such as “post-devotional” land by the Ahom kings. Rudra Singh Bargader, his father Gadadhar Singh, summoned the Mahants who met at Cheuni, Cha, etc., divided them into different classes and distributed the disciples according to the number of the Dang Sank and appointed a satra of “Etka Mahant” in Majuli. Those Mahants who do not have a base in Majuli are not real or good Mahants. The Mahaptas were divided into three classes; That will be mentioned in the appropriate place. The Satras mentioned above are divided into 4 categories, namely: 2. Mahapurushia. 3. Damodaria. They are Haridev-panthis and Sri Chaitanya-panthis. Mahapurusha Sankaradeva is the main initiator of the Bhaga religion of the Mahapurusha Satras. He was born at Alipukhuri (now near Bardowadhan); He is the satisfaction of the Bhuyan household; Pivaka&amp;#39;s name was Kusumbar. The Mahapurusha was born in Shaka 1371 (1449 AD), and died in 1591 AD (1561 AD). In the early days of Sankaradeva&amp;#39;s life, Tantric religion was very prevalent in Assam. He is strongly opposed to burdens (especially idol worship). He took summaries of many scriptures and preached the Bhagavad Gita. Later, the Mahapurusha Dharma called him Mahapurusha and Bardov Khan his preached religion They began to call it the religion of the great men. His term of office was from the age of 18 until the end of his life. Bhodhar, the main field of his life, is now known as Bardosh Than. It is a most holy place for the Agamites.

The third son Purnananda established the Gharmara Satra and the fourth son Achyutananda the Dokhoramukh Satra. Achutananda had two sons, Dayananda and Krishnananda. Dayananda remained in his satra; The second son, Krishna Nand, established a satra near Kamalabari. There his “Adhaar Bay,” became sick, multiplied, and died.

From him -Bhagati Satra Upatalia Satra Gopinath Rape is said to have explained the Bhagavad Gita well. Therefore, the satra was named &amp;#39;Ma-Bhagati&amp;#39; I haven&amp;#39;t been a gosai or gorami all the time. He is currently studying Barristerry in England. There is a Vishnu temple called Tapatal in the ditch of Dakshinpat Satra at Kalabari in Tezpur. There are many different types of ceremonies and rituals that are performed in the temple.

The first established the Krishnamishra Satra, the southern Patia Gosare established the Mahant. Who mentions this satra Not in the character-history. The ancestor was Krishnamishra. He was an unparalleled scholar in astrology and wrote 28 Smritiratnas himself. From his day onwards, the Brahmins took over the worship of the planets, sacrifices and charity, and greatly interfered with the main livelihood of the Dairajas. He was of Therejunsia colour, so Mr. Purnananda Buragohain called him a black professor in the royal assembly He was called Professor. According to legend, his ancestor was a Ganaka (or Brahmin of the fortune-teller class). In the past, people from the households of Gaj Brahmins were rumored to have joined the society of Saj Brahmins. However, in our opinion, Krishnahitra probably called him a mathematician because he studied astrology. Unlike other enumerators, there are no enumerators in our country. The counters of our country are Brahmins, they have got the name of counters because they perform calculations by astrology. Call them fortune tellers or calculators. These two words (the words fortune teller and calculator) are definite nouns, the word fortune teller means “one who knows the fortune” and the word calculator means “one who calculates”. Therefore, there is no reason to be surprised that astrologers call black professors mathematicians. That goes, when did their house become “Goshami”, and Gosain! There is no determination of who planted them. There is nothing like a book written by a black professor himself! It is not understood that he was a gosai or the satradhikar of any satra. As proof, a passage from his astrological scriptures is quoted: Natva. The two black feet or the two black feet. There is a gem in the astrological scriptures mixed with Lord Kṛṣṇa. Apart from astrology, he also had extraordinary proficiency in grammar, Smriti, Nyaya, Upanishads and Puranas.

Although Kanbajabar and others were of Kshatriya dynasty, they became known as Kayastha in Kanaujpur as they were married to Kayastha and others. After they stayed there for about three men, Shahabuddin of the Muslims invaded Kanauj. Therefore, it is important to note that the present study is not a comprehensive study of the history of the country. Then they lived in the shelter of Gaureshwar for a while. There was a special friendship between Gaureshwar Dharmanarayan and Kamateshwar Dullardnarayan at that time. In 1298 AD, Gaureshwar sent the above-mentioned seven houses of Kayastha and seven houses of Bamuns, including Chandibar, to the kingdom of Kamateshwar. When Chandibar introduced his lineage to Kamateswar and was fascinated by their virtues, Kamateswar gave them a lot of land and prisoners and daughters and gave them the title of “Bhuyan”. After a few days, some Bhuiyans, including Chandibar, went back to Kanauj and took five houses named Gadadhar, Burha Khan, Gandharva, Lohabar and Chalu Giri to Kayastha Komatapur. These five people They were given land, slaves, etc. and appointed “Bhuyans”. These 12 houses are called “Barbhuyas” in Assam goes; The remaining 7 household Brahmins are known only as Bhuyans. “Daral-genealogy” ; “Brihat Raj-vanshabali” written by order of Kochraja Harendranarayan; From the old and authentic texts like “Gamtha Charitr” it is known that besides these 12 houses of Kayastha and 7 houses of Bamuns, Brahmins, Ganakas or fortune tellers; After the death of Kays and Kamateswar Nilambar, many princes of the Khan dynasty became independent by owning large tracts of land in the kingdom of Kamata and taking the title of Bhuyan. The Koch king Biswa Singh was defeated by Narayan Gamtha of Nannartari village in Kamrup, who was also Ratantra Bhuyan; and Birnarayana, son of Narottamdeva, the ancestor of the dynasty of Nongaya Bakara, 3 (first) - Chandi, Pridhar, Hari, Srihari, Sripati, Sadananda, Chidananda or Chirananda (later) - Gadadhar, Budha Khan, Gandharva, Lohabar, Chanu Giri</content>

<content>Some San-mixed officers received the title of Bhuyan from Kamateshwar; But they have nothing to do with the Bar-Bhuyans. The ancient Assam history ( Ahom kingdom) shows that the Ahom kings also conferred some with the title of Bhuyan; such as Shalguria Bhuyan ; Panigaya Bhuyan, Hankar Bhuyan They are They have nothing to do with the Bhuyans, only the Jar-Bhuyans. Now it has been seen that the title Bhuyan may also exist among the Sati-saptas of Barbhuyan; There may also be Brahmins, Ganakas or fortune-tellers, other Kayastha, Kalitas, Kochas, Khens and Ahoms. (The Hankar Bhuyans are of Ahom nationality ) and it was seen that there is no certainty as to whether the Sati-saptati of the Swayambhu Bhuyans are in Assam. It is seen that the grandchildren of the “king-made” Bhuyans are the “Bhuyan-children” of today. In this case, “what else, the Ahom king’s curry subject.” also, such as ; It is not uncommon for “Bhuyans” to emerge among people without names like Bora, Shaikia, Hazarika, Khatwal and others. At least we don&amp;#39;t see anything so unusual. I forgot to mention that he was the smartest of all those who came with Chandib.
